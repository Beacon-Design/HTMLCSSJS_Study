# List Comprehensions 列表生成式

列表生成式即List Comprehensions，是Python内置的非常简单却强大的可以用来创建list的生成式。

Together with `for` loops, list comprehensions are one of the most prominent contexts in which the iteration protocol is applied.

要生成list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` 可以用 `list(range(1, 11))` ：

```
>>> list(range(1, 11))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```



生成 `[1*1, 2*2, 3*3, ..., 10*10]`, 列表生成式则:

```
>>> [x * x for x in range(1, 11)]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

> 相等的循环表达方式：
>
> ```
> >>> L = []
> >>> for x in range(1, 11):
> ...    L.append(x * x)
> ...
> >>> L
> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
> ```



在 `for` 循环后面还可以加上if判断，这样我们就可以筛选出仅偶数的平方：

```
>>> [x * x for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```
可以使用两层循环:

```
>>> [m + n for m in 'ABC' for n in 'XYZ']
['AX', 'AY', 'AZ', 'BX', 'BY', 'BZ', 'CX', 'CY', 'CZ']
```


example:

```
>>> L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> for i in range(len(L)): 
... 	L[i] += 10 
...
>>> L 
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
```

The list comprehension isn’t exactly the same as the for loop statement version because it makes a new list object (which might matter if there are multiple references to the original list)

```
>>> L = [x + 10 for x in L]
>>> L 
[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
```



### List Comprehension Basics

Syntactically, its syntax is derived from a construct in set theory notation that applies an operation to each item in a set, but you don’t have to know set theory to use this tool

```
L = [x + 10 for x in L]
```

Technically speaking, list comprehensions are never really required because we can always build up a list of expression results manually with for loops that append results as we go:

```
>>> res = []
>>> for x in L:
... 	res.append(x + 10) 
...
>>> res 
[31, 32, 33, 34, 35]
```

> this is exactly what the list comprehension does internally.

**list comprehensions might run much faster than manual `for` loop statements** (often roughly twice as fast) because their iterations are performed at C language speed inside the interpreter, rather than with manual Python code. Especially for larger data sets, there is often a major performance advantage to using this expression.



### Using List Comprehensions on Files

Anytime we start thinking about performing an operation on each item in a sequence, we’re in the realm of list comprehensions.

the file object has a `readlines` method that loads the file into a list of line strings all at once:

```
>>> f = open('script2.py')
>>> lines = f.readlines()
>>> lines 
['import sys\n', 'print(sys.path)\n', 'x = 2\n', 'print(x ** 32)\n']
```

each line in the list through the string `rstrip` method to remove whitespace on the right side (a `line[:−1]` slice would work, too, but only if we can be sure all lines are properly `\n` terminated, and this may not always be the case for the last line in a file):

```
>>> lines = [line.rstrip() for line in lines]
>>> lines 
['import sys', 'print(sys.path)', 'x = 2', 'print(x ** 32)']
```



### Extended List Comprehension Syntax

#### Filter clauses: if

the `for` loop nested in a comprehension expression can have an associated `if` clause to filter out of the result items for which the test is not true.

```
>>> lines = [line.rstrip() for line in open('script2.py') if line[0] == 'p']
>>> lines 
['print(sys.path)', 'print(x ** 32)']
```

we can always translate a list comprehension to a `for` statement by appending as we go and further indenting each successive part:

```
>>> res = []
>>> for line in open('script2.py'): 
... 	if line[0] == 'p':
... 		res.append(line.rstrip()) 
...
>>> res 
['print(sys.path)', 'print(x ** 32)']
```



#### Nested loops: for

List comprehensions may contain nested loops, coded as a series of `for` clauses. In fact, their full syntax allows for any number of `for` clauses, each of which can have an optional associated `if` clause.

collects all the ordered combinations of the characters in two strings:

```
>>> [x + y for x in 'abc' for y in 'lmn'] 
['al', 'am', 'an', 'bl', 'bm', 'bn', 'cl', 'cm', 'cn']
```

The following is an equivalent, but likely slower, alternative way to achieve the same effect:

```
>>> res = []
>>> for x in 'abc':
... 	for y in 'lmn':
... 		res.append(x + y) 
...
>>> res 
['al', 'am', 'an', 'bl', 'bm', 'bn', 'cl', 'cm', 'cn']
```



## List Comprehensions and Functional Tools



### List Comprehensions Versus map

List comprehensions collect the results of applying an arbitrary expression to an iterable of values and return them in a new list.

**Example 1 :** 

use a simple `for` loop and append the results to a list:

```
>>> res = []
>>> for x in 'spam':
		res.append(ord(x))			# Manual results collection

>>> res 
[115, 112, 97, 109]
```

achieve similar results with `map`

```
>>> res = list(map(ord, 'spam'))		# Apply function to sequence (or other)
>>> res 
[115, 112, 97, 109]
```

get the same results from a list comprehension expression

```
>>> res = [ord(x) for x in 'spam']		# Apply expression to sequence (or other)
>>> res 
[115, 112, 97, 109]
```

**Example 2 :** 

list comprehensions:

```
>>> [x ** 2 for x in range(10)] 
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

To do similar work with a `map` call, with a `lambda`

```
>>> list(map((lambda x: x ** 2), range(10))) 
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```



### Adding Tests and Nested Loops: filter

**Example 1 :** 

```
>>> [x for x in range(5) if x % 2 == 0] 
[0, 2, 4]

>>> list(filter((lambda x: x % 2 == 0), range(5))) 
[0, 2, 4]

>>> res = []
>>> for x in range(5):
		if x % 2 == 0: 
			res.append(x)
>>> res 
[0, 2, 4]
```

**Example 1 :** 

```
>>> [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] 
[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]

>>> list( map((lambda x: x**2), filter((lambda x: x % 2 == 0), range(10))) ) 
[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```



### Formal comprehension syntax

list comprehensions are more general still. In their simplest form, you must always code an accumulation expression and a single for clause:

```
[ expression for target in iterable ]
```

Though all other parts are optional, they allow richer iterations to be expressed—you can code any number of nested `for` loops in a list comprehension, and each may have an optional associated `if` test to act as a filter. The general structure of list comprehensions looks like this:

```
[ expression for target1 in iterable1 if condition1
			 for target2 in iterable2 if condition2 ... 
			 for targetN in iterableN if conditionN ]
```

This same syntax is inherited by set and dictionary comprehensions as well as the generator expressions coming up, though these use different enclosing characters (curly braces or often-optional parentheses), and the dictionary comprehension begins with two expressions separated by a colon (for key and value).

**Example 1 :** 

```
>>> res = [x + y for x in [0, 1, 2] for y in [100, 200, 300]]
>>> res 
[100, 200, 300, 101, 201, 301, 102, 202, 302]
```

This has the same effect as this substantially more verbose equivalent:

```
>>> res = []
>>> for x in [0, 1, 2]:
		for y in [100, 200, 300]: 
			res.append(x + y)

>>> res 
[100, 200, 300, 101, 201, 301, 102, 202, 302]
```

**Example 2 :** 

```
>>> [x + y for x in 'spam' for y in 'SPAM'] 
['sS', 'sP', 'sA', 'sM', 'pS', 'pP', 'pA', 'pM', 'aS', 'aP', 'aA', 'aM', 'mS', 'mP', 'mA', 'mM']
```

**Example 3 :** 

```
>>> [x + y for x in 'spam' if x in 'sm' for y in 'SPAM' if y in ('P', 'A')] 
['sP', 'sA', 'mP', 'mA']

>>> [x + y + z for x in 'spam' if x in 'sm' 
			   for y in 'SPAM' if y in ('P', 'A') 
			   for z in '123' if z > '1'] 
['sP2', 'sP3', 'sA2', 'sA3', 'mP2', 'mP3', 'mA2', 'mA3']
```

**Example 4 :**

```
>>> [(x, y) for x in range(5) if x % 2 == 0 for y in range(5) if y % 2 == 1] 
[(0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
```

Here is the equivalent state-ment-based code:

```
>>> res = []
>>> for x in range(5):
		if x % 2 == 0:
			for y in range(5):
				if y % 2 == 1: 
					res.append((x, y))

>>> res 
[(0, 1), (0, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
```

> if you’re confused about what a complex list comprehension does, you can always nest the list comprehension’s `for` and `if` clauses inside each other like this—indenting each clause successively further to the right—to derive the equivalent state-ments.



### Example: List Comprehensions and Matrixes

one basic way to code matrixes (a.k.a. multidimensional arrays) in Python is with nested list struc-tures.

**Example 1 :** defines two 3 × 3 matrixes as lists of nested lists:

```
>>> M = [[1, 2, 3], 
		 [4, 5, 6], 
		 [7, 8, 9]]

>>> N = [[2, 2, 2], 
		 [3, 3, 3], 
		 [4, 4, 4]]
```

index rows, and columns within rows, using normal index operations:

```
>>> M[1] 		# Row 2
[4, 5, 6]

>>> M[1][2] 	# Row 2, item 3
6
```

**Example 2 :** 

```
>>> [row[1] for row in M] 				# Column 2
[2, 5, 8]

>>> [M[row][1] for row in (0, 1, 2)] 	# Using offsets
[2, 5, 8]
```

**Example 3 :** 

```
>>> [M[i][i] for i in range(len(M))] 			# Diagonals
[1, 5, 9]

>>> [M[i][len(M)-1-i] for i in range(len(M))] 
[3, 5, 7]
```

**Example 4 :**

```
>>> L = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> for i in range(len(L)):
		for j in range(len(L[i])): 		# Update in place
			L[i][j] += 10

>>> L 
[[11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16]]
```

**Example 5 :**

```
>>> [col + 10 for row in M for col in row] 		# Assign to M to retain new value
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

>>> [[col + 10 for col in row] for row in M] 
[[11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16], [17, 18, 19]]
```

Here is the equivalent

```
>>> res = []
>>> for row in M:					# Statement equivalents 
		for col in row:				# Indent parts further right
			res.append(col + 10)

>>> res 
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

>>> res = []
>>> for row in M:
		tmp = [] 					# Left-nesting starts new list
		for col in row: 
          	tmp.append(col + 10) 
		res.append(tmp)

>>> res 
[[11, 12, 13], [14, 15, 16], [17, 18, 19]]
```

**Example 6 :**

```
>>> M 
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

>>> N 
[[2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4]]

>>> [M[row][col] * N[row][col] for row in range(3) for col in range(3)] 
[2, 4, 6, 12, 15, 18, 28, 32, 36]

>>> [[M[row][col] * N[row][col] for col in range(3)] for row in range(3)] 
[[2, 4, 6], [12, 15, 18], [28, 32, 36]]
```

Here is the equivalent

```
>>> res = []
>>> for row in range(3):
...     tmp = []
...     for col in range(3):
...         tmp.append(M[row][col] * N[row][col])
...     res.append(tmp)
... 
>>> res
[[2, 4, 9], [12, 15, 18], [28, 32, 36]]
```

**Example 7 :**

```
>>> [[col1 * col2 for (col1, col2) in zip(row1, row2)] for (row1, row2) in zip(M, N)]
[[2, 4, 9], [12, 15, 18], [28, 32, 36]]
```

Here is the equivalent

```
>>> res = []
>>> for(row1, row2) in zip(M, N):
...     tmp = []
...     for (col1, col2) in zip(row1, row2):
...         tmp.append(col1 * col2)
...     res.append(tmp)
... 
>>> res
[[2, 4, 9], [12, 15, 18], [28, 32, 36]]
```



### performance, conciseness, expressiveness\

`map` calls can be twice as fast as equivalent `for` loops, and list comprehensions are often faster than `map` calls.

`map` and list comprehensions run at C language speed inside the interpreter, which is often much faster than stepping through Python `for` loop bytecode within the PVM.
