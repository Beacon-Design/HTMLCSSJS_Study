# Modules and Packages

Python module—the highest-level program organization unit, which packages program code and data for reuse, and provides self-contained namespaces that minimize variable name clashes across your programs.

Modules are processed with two statements and one important function:

- import 

- > Lets a client (importer) fetch a module as a whole 

- from


- > Allows clients to fetch particular names from a module imp.

- reload (reload in 2.X)


- > Provides a way to reload a module’s code without stopping Python
