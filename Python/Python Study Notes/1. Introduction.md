# 1. Introduction

















### Program Execution

Run a Python File > compiled to "byte code"( .pyc file; “.pyc” means compiled “.py” source ) routed to a “virtual machine”.

Byte code compilation[^Byte code compilation] 

程序执行时，Python先将源代码编译成字节码（ 字节码执行速度更快）

In 3.2 and later, Python instead saves its .pyc byte code files in a subdirectory named __pycache__ located in the directory where your source files reside, and in files whose names identify the Python version that created them (e.g., script.cpython-33.pyc)

 Python saves byte code like this as a startup speed optimization.

###### Footnote

[^Byte code compilation]: Book **"Learning Python 5th Edition" Chapter 2 - Byte code compilation**.        Internally, and almost completely hidden from you        1. when execute a program Python first compiles your source code (the statements in your file) into a format known as byte code. Compilation is simply a translation step, and byte code is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of your source code. Roughly, Python translates each of your source statements into a group of byte code instructions by decomposing them into individual steps. This byte code translation is performed to speed execution — **byte code can be run much more quickly than the original source code statements in your text file**. In 3.2 and later, Python instead saves its .pyc byte code files in a subdirectory named __pycache__ located in the directory where your source files reside, and in files whose names identify the Python version that created them (e.g., script.cpython-33.pyc). The new __pycache__ subdirectory helps to avoid clutter, and the new naming convention for byte code files prevents different Python versions installed on the same computer from overwriting each other’s saved byte code.  though they are automatic and irrelevant to most Python programs, and are free to vary among the alternative Python implementations described ahead. In both models, Python saves byte code like this as a startup speed optimization. The next time you run your program, Python will load the .pyc files and skip the compilation step, as long as you haven’t changed your source code since the byte code was last saved, and aren’t running with a different Python than the one that created the byte code. It works like this: 1. Source changes: Python automatically checks the last-modified timestamps of source and byte code files to know when it must recompile—if you edit and resave your source code, byte code is automatically re-created the next time your program is run. 2. Python versions: Imports also check to see if the file must be recompiled because it was created by a different Python version, using either a “magic” version number in the byte code file itself in 3.2 and earlier, or the information present in byte code filenames in 3.2 and later.

1. when execute a program Python compiles the source code into a format known as byte code ( byte code is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the source code.) Python translates each of the source statements into a group of byte code instructions by decomposing them into individual steps.        

1.1. This byte code translation is performed to speed execution (byte code run much more quickly than the original source code statements in the text file.)        

2. In 3.2 and later, Python instead saves its .pyc byte code files in a subdirectory named __pycache__ located in the directory where the source files reside, and in files whose names identify the Python version that created them (e.g., script.cpython-33.pyc). The new __pycache__ subdirectory helps to avoid clutter, and the new naming convention for byte code files prevents different Python versions from overwriting each other’s saved byte code. 

In both models, Python saves byte code like this as a startup speed optimization. The next time you run your program, Python will load the .pyc files and skip the compilation step, as long as you haven’t changed your source code since the byte code was last saved, and aren’t running with a different Python than the one that created the byte code. It works like this:

• Source changes: Python automatically checks the last-modified timestamps of source and byte code files to know when it must recompile—if you edit and resave your source code, byte code is automatically re-created the next time your program is run.

• Python versions: Imports also check to see if the file must be recompiled because it was created by a different Python version, using either a “magic” version number in the byte code file itself in 3.2 and earlier, or the information present in byte code filenames in 3.2 and later.

The result is that both source code changes and differing Python version numbers will trigger a new byte code file. If Python cannot write the byte code files to your machine, your program still works—the byte code is generated in memory and simply discarded on program exit. However, because .pyc files speed startup time, you’ll want to make sure they are written for larger programs. Byte code files are also one way to ship Python programs—Python is happy to run a program if all it can find are .pyc files, even if the original .py source files are absent. (See “Frozen Binaries” on page 39 for another shipping option.)

Finally, keep in mind that byte code is saved in files only for files that are imported, not for the top-level files of a program that are only run as scripts (strictly speaking, it’s an import optimization). We’ll explore import basics in Chapter 3, and take a deeper look at imports in Part V. Moreover, a given file is only imported (and possibly compiled) once per program run, and byte code is also never saved for code typed at the interactive prompt—a programming mode we’ll learn about in Chapter 3.
