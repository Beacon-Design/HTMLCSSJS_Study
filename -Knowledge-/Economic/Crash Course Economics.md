### 05 宏观经济 Macroeconomics

> policy makers have three economic goals
>
> 1. Keep the economy growing over time
> 2. Limit unemployment
> 3. Keep prices stable
>
> There are three specific measurements that economists analyze to see if a country is achieving each goal
>
> 1. Gross domestic product (GDP) 国内生产总值
> 2. Unemployment rate 失业率
> 3. Inflation rate 通货膨胀率

##### GDP

国内生产总值（GDP=Gross Domestic Product）是指一个国家或者地区所有常驻单位在一定时期内生产的所有最终产品和劳务的市场价值。

GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced with a country's border in a specific period of time.

##### Unemployment rate

The unemployment rate is calculated by taking the number of peoplr that are unemployed and dividing by the number of people in the labor force ,times 100.

> 三种失业类型
>
> 1. **Frictional unemployment** : This is when people area temporarily unemployed or betweem jobs.
> 2. **Structural unemployment** : Workers are out of work because there's no demand for that specific type of labor.
> 3. **Cyclical unemployment** : this is unemployment due to a recession
>
> An economy is considered to be at full employment when there's only frictional and structural unemployment.This is called the natural rate of unemployment.

##### Inflation

**Inflation** is measured by tracking the prices of a set amount of commonly purchased items, or what economists call a market basket.

The **Inflation Rate** is the percent change in the price of that basket over time.



economy has four components that make up GDP.

1. Consumer spending 消费者消费
2. Business spending (Investment) 企业消费，即投资
3. Government spending 政府消费
4. Net exports 净出口（其他国家进行的消费）



### 06 生产力与增长 Productivity and Growth

GDP per capita

The United Nations Human Development Index, HDI

Productivity : Their ability to produce more output, per worker, per hour.

factors of production : 

1. natural resources. 自然资源
2. workers (labor) 劳动力
3. capital (things you need to produce other things) 资本
4. human capital (workers' education, knowledge and skills required to produce things) 人力资本

资源的质量和数量是生产力发达的第一步，更重要的是你如何使用这些东西。



### 07 通货膨胀与泡沫 Inflation and Bubbles and Tulips



**Cunsumer Basket** (消费者购物篮) :  economists first pick up a list of goods that represents what an average consumer buys in a year.

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)** (消费者物价指数) : They add up the price of this year's basket, and do the same thing next year, and the year after that.so eventually you have a long list of basket costs for a bunch of different years. Then you pick a base year. You divide the basket cost of each year by the basket cost in the base year and  multiply it times 100.

The CPI shows how prices have changed between different years. and it's by far the most commonly used measure of inflation.



"Real" means that a price from the past has been adjusted for inflation.

"Nominal" means a price from the past that hasn't been adjusted for inflation.

**adjusting for inflation**

> since we have to keep the market basket constant over time, a traditional CPI won't adjust for either new products or increases in product quality.



Inflation 通货膨胀

> 1. Demand pull inflation 需求拉动通货膨胀（too much money chasing too few goods. they're going to bid up the prices of things, causing inflation.）
> 2. Cost push inflation 成本推动通货膨胀（Supply shock 供给冲击。the decrease of avaliability of an important productive resource.）



Bubble 泡沫

**Speculation** (投机) : Trading a financial instrument involving high risk, in expectation of significant returns. 







### 08 Fiscal policy and stimulus: crash 财政政策

recessionary gap 衰退缺口 ：A situation where in the real GDP is lower than the potential GDP at the full employment level.(工人下岗，工厂没活干)

inflationary gap 通货膨胀缺口：The amount by which the actual gross domestic product exceeds potential full-employment GDP.(失业率极低，工厂加班加点干活，但不稳定，最终生产者会抬高稀缺资源的价格，更高成本会引起更多通货膨胀。) 

> Both recessionary and inflationary gaps caused serious problems.
>
> high unemployment rates have been linked to higher suicide rates, more domestic violence,and social upheaval.
>
> rising costs wiped out savings and have been the root of protests and riots throughout the world. 

**Fiscal policy** ：The way a goverment adjusts its spending levels and tax rates to monitor and influence a nation's economy.



**Expansionary fiscal policy**(扩张性财政政策): When the economy falls into a deep recessionary gap the government can increase government spending, cut taxes,or do part of both. 

**Contractionary fiscal policy** (紧缩性财政政策): in a inflationary gap, the government can cut spending and raise taxes or do some combination of the two.



> Classical theories assumed that the economy will fix itself in the long run, and that government intervention will, at best, lead to unintended consequences and, at worst, cause massive inflation and debt.

凯恩斯

**Deficit spending**（赤字支出）:The governmwnt spending more money than it collects in tax revenue.

> the more technical argument against deficit spending is it leads to something called crowding out. 
>
> If the government borrows a lot of money, that increases interest rates,making it harder for business to borrow money and buy things like factories and tools. This ewakens the economy while increasing government debt.
>
> Keynesian economists maintain that crowding out is only a problem if the economy is operating at full capacity, where all workers are employed and we're producing as much as we can.

**crowding out**（挤出效应）：Where increased public sector spending replaces,or drives down, private sector spending.



**Austerity**：Raising taxes and cutting government spending to reduce debt.



**Multiplier effect** (乘数效应)

> Strong Economy 1X Multiplier
>
> Recession 2X Multiplier

> spending on infrastructure, and aid to state & local governments, also seems to have a fairly high multiplier, about 1.5 . But general cuts to paroll and income taxes seem to have a multiplier or about 1: if the government cuts 100 in taxes, theeconomy's going to grow by about 100.



### 09 赤子与负债 Deficits & Debts

**Budget Deficit** : The amount by which a government's spending exceeds its income over a particular period of time.

**Debt** : The accumulation of budget deficits.

federal debt as percentage of GDP

**Debt ceiling** : limit on the amount of national debt that can be issued by the US treasury.



### 10 货币政策 monetary policy

Most **central banks** have two important jobs.

1. They regulate and oversee the nation's commercial banks by making sure that banks have enough money in reserve to avoid bank runs.

   > 调控和监管国家的商业银行，通过确保银行有足够的准备金防止提款浪潮（银行挤兑）

2. Conduct monetary policy which is increasing or decreasing the money supply to speed up or slow down the overall economy

   > 实施货币政策, 也就是增加或减少货币供给来加速或放慢整体经济。

**Interest Rate** : The price of borrowing money.

> When banks lend money, they except to be repaid the amount they lend, which is called the principle (本金)，and a percentage of the principle to cover inflation and to make some profit. That percentage is called the interest rate.

**Expansionary monetary policy** (扩张性货币政策) : If the central bank wants to speed up the economy, they can increase the money supply, which will decrease interest rates, and lead to more borrowing and spending.

**Contractionary monetary policy** (紧缩性货币政策) ：If the central bank wants to slow down the economy, they decrease the money supply, less money avaliable will increase interest rates and decrease spending.



**liquid assets** (流动资产) : an asset that can be converted into cash quickly and with minimal impact to the price received.



**How does a central bank change the money supply ?**

In the US ,There are three main ways.

**Fractional Reserve Banking** (部分准备金银行制度):  When you deposit money in a bank, the bank holds a portion of deposits and loans the rest out.

**Reserve Requirement** (法定准备金) : The fraction deposits that banks are required to hold in reserves is conveniently 

1. The Fed can change the money supply is by changing that requirement.

   > Decreasing the reserve requirement will increase the money supply.
   >
   > Increasing the reserve requirement decreases the money supply.
   >
   > The Fed is the banker's bank, so if a commercial bank needs money, they can borrow from The Fed.

2. The Fed can do to change the money supply is to change the interest rate that it charges banks. That interest rate is called the **Discount Rate**  (贴现率)

   > Decreasing the Discount Rate will make it easier for banks to borrow, and that'll increase the  money supply.
   >
   > Increasing that rate will decrease the money supply.

3. **Open Market Operations** (公开市场操作) ：This is when the federal reserve buys or sells short term government bonds (政府债券).

   > government bound 政府债券 (treasury bill 短期国库券) is an IOU issued by the government.(是政府发行的借条)。
   >
   > Banks hold those bounds because they earn interest and are generally less risky than stocks. If The Fed buys these previously issued government bounds from a bank, it increases that bank's liquidity and increases the money supply. If The Fed issues more bonds, the banks will have less liquidity and less money to loan out, and that'll decrease the money supply. 
   >
   > In the US, decding how many bonds to buy or sell is done by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
   >
   > the most often use.

**Quantitative Easing** (量化宽松) ： it's when central banks buy up longer term assets from banks. (So not onlywas The Fed buying regular treasury bills, it was also buying things like home loans(房贷) aka Mortgage backed securities (住房抵押贷款支持证券). They did all this with made-up money.)

> Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon - Milton Friedman  



### 11 货币与金融 Money and Finance

> **Barter System** (物物交换制)

money serves three main purposes.

1. it acts as a Medium of Exchange.
2. money canbe used as a store of value.
3. Money services as a Unit of Account.

**Financial System** : a network of institutions, markets, and contracts that brings these two groups together.(lenders put money into the financial system which loans it out to borrowers. These borrowers pay back those loans with interest shich makes it worth the lender's time.)

Three ways this exchange takes place:

1. Banks (银行).

2. Bond Market (债券市场).

   > A bond is basically an IOU in which the borrower agrees to pay regular interest payments and promise to repay all of the money back at a set date in the future.

3. the stock market (股票市场).

> Banks and Bonds have something in common: They are dealing in something called debt.
>
> Stocks: are known as equity.
>
> Bonds and stocks have something in common:  They're traded on markets for financial instruments. Bonds are debt instruments. Stocks are equity instruments.
>
> Banks: are financial institutions.
>
> **Equity** (资产) : The difference between the value of assets/interest and the cost of liabilities of something owned.
>
> **Financial Instrument** (金融工具)：A tradeable asset of any kind.
>
> **Financial Institution** (金融机构) : An establishment that conducts financial transactions such as investments, loans and deposits.
