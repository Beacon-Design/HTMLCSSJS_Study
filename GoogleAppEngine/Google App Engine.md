# Google App Engine



## Google App Engine SDK for Python



**Install Google App Engine**

Make sure you are downloading Python 2 rather than Python 3, as this is what Google App Engine uses!

**Changes to Google App Engine**

The Google App Engine system (now part of Google Cloud) has changed a lot since this course was created. You will need to create an app with a new, unique name using [**the Developer Console**](https://console.developers.google.com/) before you can deploy it. For more information, take a look at these guides written by Udacity mentor Steven Wooding: [**(Windows)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byu3UemwRffDbjd0SkdvajhIRW8/view), [**(Mac and Linux)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byu3UemwRffDc21qd3duLW9LMm8/view)

**Running Google App Engine on Mac OS**

Unfortunately Google no longer supports the GoogleAppengineLauncher program that Steve demonstrates in this video. You follow use the instructions below for Linux, or you can download the deprecated GoogleAppengineLauncher installer from the "Supporting Materials" list below. *Warning:* Use the GoogleAppengineLauncher program at your own peril! As Google no longer supports the tool it may stop working in the future. The **gcloud** command-line program is the currently supported tool.



## Run Google App Engine

1. File > New Application > Application ID : hellojohn
2. Run "hellojohn"
3. edit the  main.py of "hellojohn"
