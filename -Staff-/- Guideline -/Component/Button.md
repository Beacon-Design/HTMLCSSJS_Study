### The Primary Button

1. Set a System’s Stylistic Tone

   > color, typography, iconography

2. Set a Verbal Tone

   > How long can button labels be? Are labels written in the imperative 
   > (such as “Save” or “Close”)? Should I pair a verb (“Save”) with an 
   > object type (“Document”)? Are there preferred labels for common actions?
   >  Do we inject a brand voice…or not?

3. Invert Buttons When Backgrounds Get Complicated

   > what happens when you place it on a photograph? 
   >
   > Or a different, darker background color?
   >
   > Are you even allowed to put it on a light neutral color? 
   >
   > Can you use a button anywhere? Can you *change* the color of a primary button?
   >
   > Demonstrate viable backgrounds for your primary button, and codify an 
   > inverted alternative — white? a different color? semitransparent? — to 
   > apply when backgrounds darken. When documenting, show light and dark 
   > alternatives on a range of common backgrounds to drive the point home.

4. Limit One Per Page, Unless Repeating a Primary Action

   > We often use a primary button to draw attention to a page’s highest 
   > priority action. Until, we can’t prioritize and there’s a bunch of 
   > primary buttons littered throughout a page
   >
   > In some cases, using a primary button is appropriate when you must choose from a parallel set of objects
   >
   > Define when to use — and when to avoid — more than one primary button on a page.

5. Design and Build a Button’s Arc of Interaction

   > a button appears across many states: default, hover, focused (“haloed”),
   >  pressed / active, and even a spinning waiting or animated progression.
   >
   > Pair a live demo (just embed the button on the page!) with a gallery 
   > that shows the states without requiring readers to interact. 

6. Be Resilient to Mixed Elements

   > Pairing a button label with an icon reinforces meaning and quickens recognition.
   >
   > Craft buttons to be resilient to including additional elements, whether 
   > in code or design tools. Users will want to add things — icons, labels, 
   > whatevers — and not worry about consequences of space and alignment. Set them up for success by doing that work for them.



### The Secondary Buttons

7. Ensure Secondary ≠ Disabled

   > Solve for the secondary button colors and disabled states in concert. 
   > Make sure all your options work well together and none are inaccessible.

8. Beware of Ghosts in the Machine

   >  Inject Ghost buttons into a system at your own peril. Studies I’ve 
   > observed suggest that ghosts perform poorer than filled counterparts. 
   > Plus, you might just avoid hours spent listening to polarizing designer 
   > debates on the subject.



### Additional Button Types

9. Vary Size, Both Large (or Mega/Huge/Puffy) & Small (or Micro/Tiny)

   > Provide tooling to tune button size down and up as needed, as simple as 
   > another CSS class or design software style. Also, consider more 
   > memorable names — like “Puffy” or “Micro” — rather than a bland “Large” 
   > or “Small.”

10. Distinguish Buttons from Links

    > If your system offers a flat variant, be sure it’s conventional use — in
    >  both design and code — is distinguished from links. Additionally, cover
    >  all the interactive complexity such as *focus* & *press* states, *spacing*, and *alignment*.

11. Enrich Variety with Menus & Zones

    > Enrich your apps with options for button menuing, but cautiously. Such 
    > buttons and their zonal segmentation (left for dominant action, right 
    > for menuing) support many scenarios, but with a higher cost of code and 
    > guidance complexity. For simpler sites, don’t distract build priorities 
    > with these less-used alternatives.

12. From Toggles to Toolbars, Make Buttons Play Nice Together

    > When expanding button variety, explore and stress-test button sets in 
    > compact spaces and with varied combinations. System designers aren’t 
    > fortune tellers, able to predict the future. But exploring a reasonably 
    > diverse scenarios can help you avoid an abomination or two down the 
    > road.
