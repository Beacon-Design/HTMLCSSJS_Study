# 色彩理论

### A brief history of color theory

The first color wheel was invented by Sir Isaac Newton. He split white sunlight into red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, and blue beams; then he joined the two ends of the color spectrum together to show the natural progression of colors. Newton associated each color with a note of a musical scale.

A century after Newton, Johann Wolfgang Goethe began studying psychological effect of colors. He noticed that blue gives a feeling of coolness and yellow has a warming effect. Goethe created a color wheel showing the psychological effect of each color. He divided all the colors into two groups – the plus side (from red through orange to yellow) and the minus side (from green through violet to blue). Colors of the plus side produce excitement and cheerfulness. Colors of the minus side are associated with weakness and unsettled feelings.

The current form of color theory was developed by [Johannes Itten](http://www.dezignare.com/newsletter/Johannes_Itten.html), a Swiss color and art theorist who was teaching at the School of Applied Arts in Weimar, Germany. This school is also known as 'Bauhaus'. Johannes Itten developed 'color chords' and modified the color wheel. Itten's color wheel is based on red, yellow, and blue colors as the primary triad and includes twelve hues.



### 引言

人类最基本的视觉经验得出了一个最朴素也是最重要的结论：没有光就没有色。白天使人们能看到五色的物体，但在漆黑无光的夜晚就什么也看不见了。倘若有灯光照明，则光照到哪里，便又可看到物像及其色彩了。

真正揭开光色之谜的是英国科学家牛顿。17世纪后半期，为改进刚发明不久的望远镜的清晰度，牛顿从光线通过玻璃镜的现象开始研究。1666年，牛顿进行了著名的色散实验。他将一房间关得漆黑，只在窗户上开一条窄缝，让太阳光射进来并通过一个三角形挂体的玻璃三棱镜。结果出现了意外的奇迹：在对面墙上出现了一条七色组成的光带，而不是一片白光，七色按红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫的顺序一色紧挨一色地排列着，极像雨过天晴时出现的彩虹。同时，七色光束如果再通过一个三棱镜还能还原成白光。这条七色光带就是太阳光谱。

色彩是以色光为主体的客观存在，对于人则是一种视象感觉，产生这种感觉基于三种因素:一是光；二是物体对光的反射；三是人的视觉器官——眼。即不同波长的可见光投射到物体上，有一部分波长的光被吸收，一部分波长的光被反射出来刺激人的眼睛，经过视神经传递到大脑，形成对物体的色彩信息，即人的色彩感觉。



### 光、可见光、光谱色

所谓光，就其物理属性而言是一种电磁波，其中的一部分可以为人的视觉器官——眼所接受，并作出反应，通常被称为可见光。因此，色彩应是可见光的作用所导致的[视觉](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%A7%86%E8%A7%89)现象，可见光刺激眼睛后可引起视觉反应，使人感觉到色彩和知觉空间环境。

牛顿，在1678年首先提出，光是物体射出的一种微粒，称为光粒，它以极大的速度由发光体四向射出，达到人眼就产生光的感觉，被称为微粒说。

1678年海根斯等认为，宇宙间弥漫着一种稀薄而具有弹性的介质叫以太。物质发光，则其电子振动，经周围的以太依次传递到远方，成为一种横波，横波进入人眼引起光感，被称为[波动说](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B3%A2%E5%8A%A8%E8%AF%B4)。

1864年[麦克斯韦](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%BA%A6%E5%85%8B%E6%96%AF%E9%9F%A6)认为，光并不是以太自身的运动，而是以太之中的电磁变化而引起的传播，以太波即电波的一种，被称为电磁说。

现代科学证实，光是一种以电磁波形式存在的辐射能。它具有波动性，又具有[粒子性](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%B2%92%E5%AD%90%E6%80%A7)。光具有的这两种性质，在光学上称为“二象性”。

阳光通过三棱镜时随着波长的不同，行进的线路也不相同：紫色光波长最短，行进速度最慢，曲折最大（折射角度最大），红色光波长最长，折射角度最小，其余各色光依次排列，才形成七色光谱。光照射到不透明物体的表面时产生粒子“碰撞”，部分反射、部分被吸收，这种[反射光](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E5%85%89)作用于[视觉器官](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%A7%86%E8%A7%89%E5%99%A8%E5%AE%98)，形成[物体色](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%89%A9%E4%BD%93%E8%89%B2)的概念。这些便是[光的色散](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%85%89%E7%9A%84%E8%89%B2%E6%95%A3)现象和物体色彩本质性科学解答。

在整个电磁波范围内，并不是所有的光都有色彩。[电磁波](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%94%B5%E7%A3%81%E6%B3%A2)包括宇宙[射线](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B0%84%E7%BA%BF)、X射线、紫外线、红外线、无线电波和可见光等，它们都各有不同的波长和[振动频率](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%8C%AF%E5%8A%A8%E9%A2%91%E7%8E%87)。只有从380毫微米到780毫微米波长之间的电磁波才能引起人的色觉，这段波长叫可见光谱，即常称的光。

其余波长的电磁波都是人眼所看不见的，通称不可见光，实际上是不同的射线或电波。波长长于780毫微米的电磁波称为红外线，短于380毫微米的电磁波叫紫外线。各种光具有不同的波长，其大小仍用毫微米来计量。

由三棱镜分解出来的色光，如果用光度计来测定，就可得出各色光的波长。因此，色的概念实际上是不同波长的光刺激人的眼睛所产生的视觉反映。

光的物理性质由光波的振幅和波长两个因素决定。波长的长度差别决定[色相](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%89%B2%E7%9B%B8)的差别。波长相同而振幅不同，则决定色相明暗的差别，即明度差别。

有光才会有色，光产生于光源。光源有自然的和人造的两类。和所有的灯光都是由各种波长与频率的色光组成的，这些色光依次排列，即所谓“光谱”。不同光谱的灯如白炽灯、荧光灯等所发出的光，其色彩感觉也不同。



### 太阳光谱

是一种不同波长的连续光谱。分为可见光与不可见光2部分。可见光的波长为400～760nm，散射后分为红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫7色，集中起来则为白光。不可见光，又分为2种：位于红光之外区的叫红外线，波长大于760nm，最长达5 300nm;位于紫光之外区的叫紫外线，波长290～400nm。太阳光具有明显生物效应，植物在太阳光作用下可发生合成作用，动物皮肤在太阳光作用下维生素D发生转换作用;红外线具有巨大的热效应，紫外线有明显杀菌作用等。

太阳平日所放出来的光谱主要来自太阳表面绝对温度约六千度的[黑体辐射](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%BB%91%E4%BD%93%E8%BE%90%E5%B0%84)(Black Body Radiation)光谱可见光的波长范围在770～390纳米之间，看不见的波段从770~11590纳米。波长不同的电磁波，引起人眼的颜色感觉不同。770～622nm，感觉为红色；622～597nm，橙色；597～577nm，黄色；577～492nm，绿色；492～455nm，蓝靛色；455～390nm，紫色。

### 光源色、物体色、固有色

物体色的呈现是与照射物体的光源色、物体的物理特性有关的。

同一物体在不同的光源下将呈现不同的色彩：在白光照射下的白纸呈白色，在红光照射下的白纸成红色，在绿光照射下的白纸呈绿色。因此，光源色光谱成分的变化，必然对物体色产生影响。电灯光下的物体带黄，日光灯下的物体偏青，电焊光下的物体偏浅青紫，晨曦与夕阳下的景物呈桔红、桔黄色，白昼阳光下的景物带浅黄色，月光下的景物偏青绿色等。光源色的光亮强度也会对照射物体产生影响，强光下的物体色会变淡，弱光下的物本色会变得模糊晦暗，只有在中等光线强度下的物体色最清晰可见。

物理学家发现光线照射到物体上以后，会产生吸收、反射、透射等现象。而且，各种物体都具有选择性地吸收、反射、透射色光的特性。以物体对光的作用而言，大体可分为不透光和透光两类，通常称为不透明体和透明体。对于不透明物体，它们的颜色取决于对波长不同的各种色光的反射和吸收情况。如果一个物体几乎能反射阳光中的所有色光，那么该物体就是白色的。反之，如果一个物体几乎能吸收阳光中的所有色光，那么该物体就呈黑色。如果一个物体只反射波长为700毫微米左右的光，而吸收其它各种波长的光，那么这个物体看上去则是红色的。可见，不透明物体的颜色是由它所反射的色光决定的，实质上是指物体反射某些色光并吸收某些色光的特性。透明物体的颜色是由它所透过的色光决定的。红色的玻璃所以呈红色，是因为它只透过红光，吸收其它色光的缘故。照相机镜头上用的滤色镜，不是指将镜头所呈颜色的光滤去，实际上是让这种颜色的光通过，而把其它颜色的光滤去。由于每一种物体对各种波长的光都具有选择性的吸收与反射、透射的特殊功能，所以它们在相同条件下（如：光源、距离、环境等因素），就具有相对不变的色彩差别。人们习惯把白色阳光下物体呈现的色彩效果，称之为物体的“固有色”。如白光下的红花绿叶绝不会在红光下仍然呈现红花绿叶，红花可显得更红些，而绿光并不具备反射红光的特性，相反它吸收红光，因此绿叶在红光下就呈现黑色了。此时，感觉为黑色叶子的黑色仍可认为是绿叶在红光下的物体色，而绿叶之所以为绿叶，是因为常态光源（阳光）下呈绿色，绿色就约定俗成地被认为是绿叶的固有色。严格地说，所谓的固有色应是指“物体固有的物理属性”在常态光源下产生的色彩。

在使用“固有色”一词时，需要特别提醒的是切勿误解为某物体的颜色是固定不变的，这种偏见就是在研究光色关系和作色彩写生必克服的“固有色观念”。



### 选择红绿蓝的生理原因

三原色的原理不是出于物理原因，而是由于生理原因造成的。人的眼睛内有几种辨别颜色的锥形感光细胞，分别对黄绿色、绿色和蓝紫色（或称紫罗兰色）的光最敏感（波长分别为564、534和420纳米），如果辨别黄绿色的细胞受到的刺激略大于辨别绿色的细胞，人的感觉是黄色；如果辨别黄绿色的细胞受到的刺激大大高于辨别绿色的细胞，人的感觉是红色。虽然三种细胞并不是分别对红色、绿色和蓝色最敏感，但这三种光可以分别对三种锥形细胞产生刺激。

不同的生物眼中辨别颜色的细胞并不相同，例如鸟类眼中有四种分别对不同波长光线敏感的细胞，而一般哺乳动物只有两种，所以对它们来说只有两种原色光。

使用三原色并不足以重现所有的色彩，准确地说法应该是“将三原色光以不同的比例复合后，对人的眼睛可以形成与各种频率的可见光等效的色觉。”只有那些在三原色的色度所定义的颜色三角内的颜色，才可以利用三原色的光以非负量相加混合得到。

例如，红光与绿光按某种比例复合，对三种锥状细胞刺激后产生的色觉可与眼睛对单纯的黄光的色觉等效。但决不能认为红光与绿光按某种比例复合后生成黄光，或黄光是由红光和绿光复合而成的。

##### 视锥细胞

视锥细胞功能的重要特点，是它有辨别颜色的能力。颜色视觉是一种复杂的物理-心理现象，颜色的不同，主要是不同波长的光线作用于视网膜后在人脑引起的主观印象。人眼一般可在光谱上区分出红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫等七种颜色，每种颜色都与一定波长的光线相对应；但仔细的检查可以发现，单是人眼在光谱可区分的色泽实际不下150种，说明在[可见光谱](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8F%AF%E8%A7%81%E5%85%89%E8%B0%B1)的范围内波长长度只要有3-5nm的增减，就可被视觉系统分辨为不同的颜色。





## Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Colors

### 原色 (Primary Color)

色彩中不能再分解的基本色称为原色。原色能合成出其它色，而其他色不能还原出本来的颜色。原色只有三种。

##### 色光三原色

红 (red)、绿 (green)、蓝 (blue)。叠加型的三原色 (加法三原色) ，又称三基色。光线会越加越亮，两两混合可以得到更亮的中间色：yellow黄、magenta品红、cyan青。三种等量组合可以得到白色。用于电视机、投影仪等显示设备。

![RGB_illumination](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/RGB_illumination.jpg)

从能量的观点来看，色光混合是亮度的叠加，混合后的色光必然要亮于混合前的各个色光，只有明亮度低的色光作为原色才能混合出数目比较多的色彩，否则，用明亮度高的色光作为原色，其相加则更亮，这样就永远不能混合出那些明亮度低的色光。同时，三原色应具有独立性，三原色不能集中在可见光光谱的某一段区域内，否则，不仅不能混合出其它区域的色光，而且所选的原色也可能由其它两色混合得到，失去其独立性，而不是真正的原色。



##### 颜料三原色

品红 (明亮的玫红，magenta)、黄 (yellow)、青 (湖蓝，cyan)。消减型的三原色， (减法三原色) 从理论上来讲可以调配出其他任何色彩，同色相加得黑色，因为常用的颜料中除了色素外还含有其它化学成分，所以两种以上的颜料相调和，纯度就受影响，调和的色种越多就越不纯，也越不鲜明，颜料三原色相加只能得到一种黑浊色，但实际上是深灰色而不是纯黑色。因此需要独立的黑色颜料。颜料吸收光线，而不是将光线叠加，因此颜料的三原色就是能够吸收RGB的颜色，为青、黄、品红（CMY），他们就是RGB的补色。三色颜料加上黑色(K)便是“CMYK色彩空间”。用于书本、杂志等的印刷（我们看到印刷的颜色，实际上都是看到的纸张反射的光线）。

把黄色颜料和青色颜料混合起来，因为黄色颜料吸收蓝光，青色颜料吸收红光，因此只有绿色光反射出来，这就是黄色颜料加上青色颜料形成绿色的道理。

光的三原色是红色、绿色和蓝色，三种光相加会成为白色光。这是由于人类有三种视锥细胞分别对红、绿和蓝光最敏感。

![CMYK_subtractive_color](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/CMYK_subtractive_color.png)





**透明体的颜色是由它本身的色光决定，不透明体的颜色由他反射的色光决定**



### 间色 (Secondary Color)

由两个原色混合得间色。间色也只有三种。

色光三间色为品红 (magenta)、黄 (yellow)、青（湖蓝，cyan），或称为“补色”，是指色环上的互补关系。补色指完全不含另一种颜色，红和绿混合成黄色，因为完全不含蓝色，所以黄色就是蓝色的补色。两个等量补色混合也形成白色。红色与绿色经过一定比例混合后就是黄色了。所以黄色不能称之为三原色。



颜料三间色为橙 (orange)、绿 (green)、紫 (purple)，也称第二次色。

必须指出的是色光三间色恰好是颜料的三原色。这种交错关系构成了色光、颜料与色彩视觉的复杂联系，也构成了色彩原理与规律的丰富内容。



### 复色 (Tertiary Color)

颜料的两个间色或一种原色和其对应的间色（红与青、黄与蓝、绿与洋红）相混合得复色，亦称第三次色。复色中包含了所有的原色成分，只是各原色间的比例不等，从而形成了不同的红灰、黄灰、绿灰等灰调色。

由于色光三原色相加得白色光，这样便产生两个后果：一是色光中没有复色，二是色光中没有灰调色,如两色光间色相加，只会产生一种淡的原色光，以黄色光加青色光为例：

黄色光+青色光 = 红色光+绿色光+绿色光+蓝色光 = 绿色光+白色光 = 亮绿色光



## Warm and cool colors

![warm-cool](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/warm-cool.gif)

The color circle can be divided into warm and cool colors.

**Warm colors** are vivid and energetic, and tend to advance in space.

**Cool colors** give an impression of calm, and create a soothing impression.

White, black and gray are considered to be neutral.



## Tint, Shade, and Tone

These terms are often used incorrectly, although they describe fairly simple color concepts. If a color is made lighter by adding white, the result is called a **tint**. If black is added, the darker version is called a **shade**. And if gray is added, the result is a different **tone**.

**Tints** - adding white to a pure hue:

![Tints](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/Tints.gif)

**Shades** - adding black to a pure hue:

![Shades](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/Shades.gif)

**Tones** - adding gray to a pure hue:

![Tones](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/Tones.gif)





## Color theory does not analyze tints, shades, and tones

Color theory analyzes only the relationships of pure colors; it does not take color lightness and saturation into account. While your color scheme can use any tints, shades, and tones, color theory pays attention only to the hue component.



## The Color Wheel

The **color wheel** or **color circle** is the basic tool for combining colors. The first circular color diagram was designed by Sir Isaac Newton in 1666. 

Over the years, many variations of the basic design have been made, but the most common version is a wheel of 12 colors based on the RYB (or artistic) color model.

Traditionally, there are a number of color combinations that are considered especially pleasing. These are called **color harmonies** or **color chords** and they consist of two or more colors with a fixed relation in the color wheel.











## Color Harmony

basic techniques for creating color schemes



### Monochromatic color

![monochromatic](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/monochromatic.jpg)

The monochromatic color scheme uses variations in lightness and saturation of a single color. This scheme looks clean and elegant. Monochromatic colors go well together, producing a soothing effect. The monochromatic scheme is very easy on the eyes, especially with blue or green hues. You can use it to establish an overall mood. The primary color can be integrated with neutral colors such as black, white, or gray. However, it can be difficult, when using this scheme, to highlight the most important elements.

**Pros:**

The monochromatic scheme is easy to manage, and always looks balanced and visually appealing.

**Cons:**	

This scheme lacks color contrast. It is not as vibrant as the complementary scheme.

**Tips:**	

1. Use tints, shades, and tones of the key color to enhance the scheme.
2. Try the analogous scheme; it offers more nuances while retaining the simplicity and elegance of the monochromatic scheme.



### Analogous color

![analogous](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/analogous.jpg)

The analogous color scheme uses colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. One color is used as a dominant color while others are used to enrich the scheme. The analogous scheme is similar to the monochromatic one, but offers more nuances.

They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs.

Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.

Make sure you have enough contrast when choosing an analogous color scheme.

Choose one color to dominate, a second to support. The third color is used (along with black, white or gray) as an accent.

**Pros:**

The analogous color scheme is as easy to create as the monochromatic, but looks richer.

**Cons:**	

The analogous color scheme lacks color contrast. It is not as vibrant as the complementary scheme.

**Tips:**	

1. Avoid using too many hues in the analogous scheme, because this may ruin the harmony.
2. Avoid combining warm and cool colors in this scheme.



### Complementary Color

![complementary](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/complementary.jpg)

The complementary color scheme is made of two colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. This scheme looks best when you put a warm color against a cool color, for example, red versus green-blue. The complementary scheme is intrinsically high-contrast.

When using the complementary scheme, it is important to choose a dominant color and use its complementary color for accents. Using one color for the background and its complementary color to highlight important elements, you will get color dominance combined with sharp color contrast.

The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation. This color scheme must be managed well so it is not jarring.

Complementary color schemes are tricky to use in large doses, but work well when you want something to stand out.

Complementary colors are really bad for text. 

**Pros:**

The complementary color scheme offers stronger contrast than any other color scheme, and draws maximum attention.

**Cons:**	

This scheme is harder to balance than monochromatic and analogous schemes, especially when desaturated warm colors are used.

**Tips:**	

1. For best results, place cool colors against warm ones, for example, blue versus orange.
2. If you use a warm color (red or yellow) as an accent, you can desaturate the opposite cool colors to put more emphasis on the warm colors.
3. Avoid using desaturated warm colors (e.g. browns or dull yellows).
4. Try the split complementary scheme; it is similar to the complementary scheme but offers more variety.



### Split complementary color

![split-complementary](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/split-complementary.jpg)

The split complementary scheme is a variation of the standard complementary scheme. It uses a color and the two colors adjacent to its complementary. This provides high contrast without the strong tension of the complementary scheme.

The split-complimentary color scheme is often a good choice for beginners, because it is difficult to mess up.

**Pros:**

The split complementary scheme offers more nuances than the complementary scheme while retaining strong visual contrast.

**Cons:**	

The split complementary scheme is harder to balance than monochromatic and analogous color schemes.

**Tips:**	

1. Use a single warm color against a range of cool colors to put an emphasis on the warm color (red versus blues and blue-greens, or orange versus blues and blue-violets).
2. Avoid using desaturated warm colors (e.g. browns or dull yellows), because this may ruin the scheme.



### Triadic

![triadic](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/triadic.jpg)

The triadic color scheme uses three colors equally spaced around the color wheel. This scheme is popular among artists because it offers strong visual contrast while retaining balance, and color richness. The triadic scheme is not as contrasting as the complementary scheme, but it looks more balanced and harmonious.

Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.

To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.

**Pros:**	

The triadic color scheme offers high contrast while retaining harmony.

**Cons:**	

The triadic color scheme is not as contrasting as the complementary scheme.

**Tips:**	

1. Choose one color to be used in larger amounts than others.


1. If the colors look gaudy, try to subdue them.



### Tetradic (double complementary / rectangle) color

![tetradic](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/tetradic.jpg)

The tetradic (double complementary / rectangle) scheme is the richest of all the schemes because it uses four colors arranged into two complementary color pairs. This scheme is hard to harmonize; if all four colors are used in equal amounts, the scheme may look unbalanced, so you should choose a color to be dominant or subdue the colors.

You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.

**Pros:**	

The tetradic scheme offers more color variety than any other scheme.

**Cons:**	

This scheme is the hardest scheme to balance.

**Tips:**	

1. If the scheme looks unbalanced, try to subdue one or more colors.
2. Avoid using pure colors in equal amounts.



### Square color

![Square](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/Square.gif)

The square color scheme is similar to the rectangle, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle.

Square color schemes works best if you let one color be dominant.

You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.



## Visual vs. Mixing Color Wheel

### Mixing (red-yellow-blue) color wheel

Traditionally, artists used a color wheel composed of the primary colors red, yellow, and blue. Currently, the mixing color wheel is commonly accepted as a visual representation of color theory. This color wheel was invented by Johannes Itten, a Swiss color and art theorist. According to Itten, the primary use of his color wheel is for mixing pigments. However, many artists use this color wheel to create visually harmonious color combinations.



### Visual (red-green-blue) color wheel

As opposed to the mixing version of the color wheel, the visual color wheel is based on the primary colors red, green, and blue. The RGB primaries are used for computer monitors, cameras, scanners, etc. The secondary (subtractive) triad of the RGB wheel is CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow), which is a standard in printing. Also, the human eye contains RGB receptors. Because of this fact, many artists believe that the visual RGB color wheel should be used instead of the traditional RYB wheel to create visual complements.



### Which wheel to choose?

The visual RGB wheel because it reflects human color perception correctly. Of course, you can experiment with both types of the color wheel.





## Color Meaning

![psychology-behind-colors](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/psychology-behind-colors.png)

### Red

Red is the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love.

Red is a very emotionally intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stoplights, and fire equipment are usually painted red. In heraldry, red is used to indicate courage. It is a color found in many national flags.

Red brings text and images to the foreground. Use it as an accent color to stimulate people to make quick decisions; it is a perfect color for 'Buy Now' or 'Click Here' buttons on Internet banners and websites. In advertising, red is often used to evoke erotic feelings (red lips, red nails, red-light districts, 'Lady in Red', etc). Red is widely used to indicate danger (high voltage signs, traffic lights). This color is also commonly associated with energy, so you can use it when promoting energy drinks, games, cars, items related to sports and high physical activity.

**Light red** represents joy, sexuality, passion, sensitivity, and love. 
**Pink** signifies romance, love, and friendship. It denotes feminine qualities and passiveness.
**Dark red** is associated with vigor, willpower, rage, anger, leadership, courage, longing, malice, and wrath.
**Brown** suggests stability and denotes masculine qualities.
**Reddish-brown** is associated with harvest and fall.



### Orange

Orange combines the energy of red and the happiness of yellow. It is associated with joy, sunshine, and the tropics. Orange represents enthusiasm, fascination, happiness, creativity, determination, attraction, success, encouragement, and stimulation.

To the human eye, orange is a very hot color, so it gives the sensation of heat. Nevertheless, orange is not as aggressive as red. Orange increases oxygen supply to the brain, produces an invigorating effect, and stimulates mental activity. It is highly accepted among young people. As a citrus color, orange is associated with healthy food and stimulates appetite. Orange is the color of fall and harvest. In heraldry, orange is symbolic of strength and endurance.

Orange has very high visibility, so you can use it to catch attention and highlight the most important elements of your design. Orange is very effective for promoting food products and toys.

**Dark orange** can mean deceit and distrust.
**Red-orange** corresponds to desire, sexual passion, pleasure, domination, aggression, and thirst for action.
**Gold** evokes the feeling of prestige. The meaning of gold is illumination, wisdom, and wealth. Gold often symbolizes high quality.



### Yellow

Yellow is the color of sunshine. It's associated with joy, happiness, intellect, and energy.

Yellow produces a warming effect, arouses cheerfulness, stimulates mental activity, and generates muscle energy. Yellow is often associated with food. Bright, pure yellow is an attention getter, which is the reason taxicabs are painted this color. When overused, yellow may have a disturbing effect; it is known that babies cry more in yellow rooms. Yellow is seen before other colors when placed against black; this combination is often used to issue a warning. In heraldry, yellow indicates honor and loyalty. Later the meaning of yellow was connected with cowardice.

Use yellow to evoke pleasant, cheerful feelings. You can choose yellow to promote children's products and items related to leisure. Yellow is very effective for attracting attention, so use it to highlight the most important elements of your design. Men usually perceive yellow as a very lighthearted, 'childish' color, so it is not recommended to use yellow when selling prestigious, expensive products to men – nobody will buy a yellow business suit or a yellow Mercedes. Yellow is an unstable and spontaneous color, so avoid using yellow if you want to suggest stability and safety. Light yellow tends to disappear into white, so it usually needs a dark color to highlight it. Shades of yellow are visually unappealing because they loose cheerfulness and become dingy.

**Dull (dingy) yellow** represents caution, decay, sickness, and jealousy. 
**Light yellow** is associated with intellect, freshness, and joy.



### Green

Green is the color of nature. It symbolizes growth, harmony, freshness, and fertility. Green has strong emotional correspondence with safety. Dark green is also commonly associated with money.

Green has great healing power. It is the most restful color for the human eye; it can improve vision. Green suggests stability and endurance. Sometimes green denotes lack of experience; for example, a 'greenhorn' is a novice. In heraldry, green indicates growth and hope. Green, as opposed to red, means safety; it is the color of free passage in road traffic.

Use green to indicate safety when advertising drugs and medical products. Green is directly related to nature, so you can use it to promote 'green' products. Dull, darker green is commonly associated with money, the financial world, banking, and Wall Street.

**Dark green** is associated with ambition, greed, and jealousy.
**Yellow-green** can indicate sickness, cowardice, discord, and jealousy.
**Aqua** is associated with emotional healing and protection.
**Olive green** is the traditional color of peace.



### Blue

Blue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven.

Blue is considered beneficial to the mind and body. It slows human metabolism and produces a calming effect. Blue is strongly associated with tranquility and calmness. In heraldry, blue is used to symbolize piety and sincerity.

You can use blue to promote products and services related to cleanliness (water purification filters, cleaning liquids, vodka), air and sky (airlines, airports, air conditioners), water and sea (sea voyages, mineral water). As opposed to emotionally warm colors like red, orange, and yellow; blue is linked to consciousness and intellect. Use blue to suggest precision when promoting high-tech products.

Blue is a masculine color; according to studies, it is highly accepted among males. Dark blue is associated with depth, expertise, and stability; it is a preferred color for corporate America.

Avoid using blue when promoting food and cooking, because blue suppresses appetite. When used together with warm colors like yellow or red, blue can create high-impact, vibrant designs; for example, blue-yellow-red is a perfect color scheme for a superhero.

**Light blue** is associated with health, healing, tranquility, understanding, and softness.
**Dark blue** represents knowledge, power, integrity, and seriousness.



### Purple

Purple combines the stability of blue and the energy of red. Purple is associated with royalty. It symbolizes power, nobility, luxury, and ambition. It conveys wealth and extravagance. Purple is associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic.

According to surveys, almost 75 percent of pre-adolescent children prefer purple to all other colors. Purple is a very rare color in nature; some people consider it to be artificial.

Light purple is a good choice for a feminine design. You can use bright purple when promoting children's products.

**Light purple** evokes romantic and nostalgic feelings.
**Dark purple** evokes gloom and sad feelings. It can cause frustration.



### White

White is associated with light, goodness, innocence, purity, and virginity. It is considered to be the color of perfection.

White means safety, purity, and cleanliness. As opposed to black, white usually has a positive connotation. White can represent a successful beginning. In heraldry, white depicts faith and purity.

In advertising, white is associated with coolness and cleanliness because it's the color of snow. You can use white to suggest simplicity in high-tech products. White is an appropriate color for charitable organizations; angels are usually imagined wearing white clothes. White is associated with hospitals, doctors, and sterility, so you can use white to suggest safety when promoting medical products. White is often associated with low weight, low-fat food, and dairy products.



### Black

Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, death, evil, and mystery.

Black is a mysterious color associated with fear and the unknown (black holes). It usually has a negative connotation (blacklist, black humor, 'black death'). Black denotes strength and authority; it is considered to be a very formal, elegant, and prestigious color (black tie, black Mercedes). In heraldry, black is the symbol of grief.

Black gives the feeling of perspective and depth, but a black background diminishes readability. A black suit or dress can make you look thinner. When designing for a gallery of art or photography, you can use a black or gray background to make the other colors stand out. Black contrasts well with bright colors. Combined with red or orange – other very powerful colors – black gives a very aggressive color scheme.

## 色彩技术



### 非线性

由于[gamma校正](https://baike.baidu.com/item/gamma%E6%A0%A1%E6%AD%A3)，在计算机显示设备上的颜色输出的强度通常不是直接正比于在图象文件中R, G和B值。就是说，即使值0.5非常接近于0到1.0（完全强度）的一半，计算机显示器在显示 (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)时候的光强度通常（在标准2.2-gamma CRT/LCD上）是在显示 (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)时候的大约22%，而不是50%。



### 数值表示

一个颜色显示的描述是由三个数值控制的，他分别为R、G、B。但三个数值位为最大时，显示为白色，当三个数值最小时，显示为黑色。

| 方式    | RGB表示                    |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| 浮点    | （1.0，0.0,0.0）            |
| 百分比   | （100%，50%，0%）            |
| 八位数字  | （255,0,0）或 #FF0000（十六进制） |
| 十六位数字 | （65535,0,0）              |

### 16比特模式

16比特模式分配给每种原色各为5比特，其中绿色为6比特，因为人眼对绿色分辨的色调更精确。但某些情况下每种原色各占5比特，余下的1比特不使用。

### 24比特模式

每像素24位（比特s per pixel，bpp）编码的RGB值：使用三个8位无符号整数（0到255）表示红色、绿色和蓝色的强度。这是当前主流的标准表示方法，用于[真彩色](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%9C%9F%E5%BD%A9%E8%89%B2)和[JPEG](https://baike.baidu.com/item/JPEG)或者[TIFF](https://baike.baidu.com/item/TIFF)等图像文件格式里的通用颜色交换。它可以产生一千六百万种颜色组合，对人眼来说其中很多已经分辨不开。

使用名为“全值域” RGB的约定。颜色值也经常被认为是取值于0.0到1.0之间，这可以被映射到其他数字编码。

使用每原色8-比特的全值域RGB可以有256级别的白-灰-黑深浅变化，255个级别的红色、绿色和蓝色（和它们的等量混合）的深浅变化，但是其他[色相](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%89%B2%E7%9B%B8)的深浅变化要少一些。由于[gamma校正](https://baike.baidu.com/item/gamma%E6%A0%A1%E6%AD%A3)，256级别不表示同等间隔的强度。

作为典型，[数字视频](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E8%A7%86%E9%A2%91)的RGB不是全值域的。视频RGB是有比例和偏移量的约定，即 (16, 16, 16)是黑色，(235, 235, 235)是白色。例如，这种比例和偏移量用在了CCIR 601的数字RGB定义中。

### 32比特模式

实际就是**24比特模式**，余下的8比特不分配到象素中，这种模式是为了提高数据输送的速度（32比特为一个[DWORD](https://baike.baidu.com/item/DWORD)，DWORD全称为Double Word，一般而言一个Word为16比特或2个字节，处理器可直接对其运算而不需额外的转换）。同样在一些特殊情况下，如DirectX、[OpenGL](https://baike.baidu.com/item/OpenGL)等环境，余下的8比特用来表示象素的透明度（Alpha）。

### 48比特模式

这种模式分配到每种原色16比特，每种颜色可以有65536个色调，是一种专业用的图象编辑显示，如用于[Photoshop](https://baike.baidu.com/item/Photoshop)，可以制作颜色非常精确的图象。



### 网站设计颜色

网站设计颜色应用的也是三原色光24比特模式，但网景色谱（[Netscape](https://baike.baidu.com/item/Netscape)Color Cube）将其确定为216种，用6种数码#00, #33, #66, #99, #CC, #FF组合成216种排列方法表示颜色。一般用户就不会被1670万种颜色所迷惑。这种表示颜色的方式被互联网在HTML 3.2采纳为标准方法。此色谱又被称为安全色板（Safe Palette）。



## Color Models

### RGB

The **RGB** (**R**ed, **G**reen, **B**lue) color model defines a color space in terms of three components:

- **R**ed, which ranges from 0-255
- **G**reen, which ranges from 0-255
- **B**lue, which ranges from 0-255

The **RGB** color model is an additive one. In other words, **R**ed, **G**reen and **B**lue values (known as the three primary colors) are combined to reproduce other colors.
For example, the color "Red" can be represented as [R=255, G=0, B=0], "Violet" as [R=238, G=130, B=238], etc.

![rgb-colors](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/rgb-colors.jpg)

The importance of RGB as a color model is that it relates very closely to the way we perceive color with the r g b receptors in our retinas. RGB is the basic color model used in television or any other medium that projects the color. It is the basic color model on computers and is used for Web graphics, but it cannot be used for print production.



### CMYK color space

The **CMYK** color space, also known as **CMJN**, stands for:

**Cyan**: Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications.

**Magenta**: Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications.

**Yellow**: Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications.

**blacK**: Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications.

It is a subtractive color model used in color printing. **CMYK** works on an optical illusion that is based on light absorption. The principle is to superimpose three images; one for cyan, one for magenta and one for yellow; which will reproduce colors.

![cmyk-colors](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/cmyk-colors.jpg)

Like the **RGB** color model, **CMYK** is a combination of primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow and black). It is, probably, the only thing they have in common.
**CMYK** suffers from a lack of color shades that causes holes in the color spectrum it can reproduce. 

> That's why there are often differencies when someone convert a color between **CMYK** to **RGB**.

(Just as the primary colors of CMY are the secondary colors of RGB, the primary colors of RGB are the secondary colors of CMY.) But as the illustrations show, the colors created by the subtractive model of CMY don't look exactly like the colors created in the additive model of RGB. Particularly, **CMY cannot reproduce the brightness of RGB colors**. In addition, **the CMY gamut is much smaller than the RGB gamut**





Why using this model? Why black is used? you can tell me... Well it's only for practical purpose. Wikipedia said:

- To improve print quality and reduce moiré patterns,
- Text is typically printed in black and includes fine detail (such as serifs); so to reproduce text using three inks would require an extremely precise alignment for each three components image.
- A combination of cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments don't produce (or rarely) pure black.
- Mixing all three color inks together to make black can make the paper rather wet when not using dry toner, which is an issue in high speed printing where the paper must dry extremely rapidly to avoid marking the next sheet, and poor quality paper such as newsprint may break if it becomes too wet.
- Using a unit amount of black ink rather than three unit amounts of the process color inks can lead to significant cost savings (black ink is often cheaper).

The subtractive color model in printing operates not only with CMY(K), but also with spot colors, that is, pre-mixed inks.



### Gamut Constraints 

when we look at the RGB and CMY color models—which are essentially models of color production—we see that the gamut of colors we can reproduce is far less than what we can actually see.



### HSB color space

The **HSB** (**H**ue, **S**aturation, **B**rightness) color model defines a color space in terms of three constituent components:

**Hue** : the color type (such as red, blue, or yellow).

Ranges from 0 to 360° in most applications. (each value corresponds to one color : 0 is red, 45 is a shade of orange and 55 is a shade of yellow).

**Saturation** : the intensity of the color.

Ranges from 0 to 100% (0 means no color, that is a shade of grey between black and white; 100 means intense color).

Also sometimes called the "purity" by analogy to the **colorimetric** quantities excitation purity.

**Brightness** (or Value) : the brightness of the color.

Ranges from 0 to 100% (0 is always black; depending on the saturation, 100 may be white or a more or less saturated color).

![hsv](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/hsv.png)

The **HSB** model is also known as **HSV** (**H**ue, **S**aturation, **V**alue) model. The **HSV** model was created in 1978 by [Alvy Ray Smith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvy_Ray_Smith). It is a nonlinear transformation of the RGB color space. In other words, color is not defined as a simple combination (addition/substraction) of primary colors but as a mathematical transformation.



### HSL color space

The **HSL** color space, also called **HLS** or **HSI**, stands for:

**Hue** : the color type (such as red, blue, or yellow).

Ranges from 0 to 360° in most applications (each value corresponds to one color : 0 is red, 45 is a shade of orange and 55 is a shade of yellow).

**Saturation** : variation of the color depending on the lightness.

Ranges from 0 to 100% (from the center of the black&white axis).

**Lightness** (also Luminance or Luminosity or Intensity).

Ranges from 0 to 100% (from black to white).

![hsl](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/hsl.png)

**HSL** is similar to **HSB**. The main difference is that **HSL** is symmetrical to lightness and darkness. This means that:

- In **HSL**, the Saturation component always goes from fully saturated color to the equivalent gray (in **HSB**, with B at maximum, it goes from saturated color to white).
- In **HSL**, the Lightness always spans the entire range from black through the chosen hue to white (in **HSB**, the B component only goes half that way, from black to the chosen hue).

For my part, **HSL** offers a more accurate (even if it's not absolute) color approximation than **HSB**.









### YUV color space

The **YUV** model defines a color space in terms of one luma and two chrominance components and is similar to **YPbPr** and **YCbCr**. The **YUV** color model is used in the PAL, NTSC, and SECAM composite color video standards.
**YUV** models human perception of color more closely than the standard RGB model used in computer graphics hardware.

The **YUV** color space stands for:

**Y**, the luma component, or the brightness. Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications.

**U** and **V** are the chrominance components (blue-luminance and red-luminance differences components). Expressed as factors depending on the **YUV** version you want to use.

![yuv](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Color/Color Img/yuv.png)





# How to use color



### The right color

1. Connect with your client's target audience
2. Doesn't look like colors being usde by your client's competitors. (Come across as original)
3. Expresses what your client makes or does. (Represent the client's product)



### Choose color

1. ask the clients the people they want connect with. (what they intrested in)
2. what the competitors using for their branding etc.
3. setup color choise. (the look, the feel, the purpose, the flavor, the product servic eyour client offers. communicate with color)






Hue = color

Saturation = intensity

Value = lightness or darkness

# Color in Design Systems

> https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/color-in-design-systems-a1c80f65fa3

### Primary Palette

1. Stabilize Brand Colors Quickly

   > Decide your essential brand colors early, because they spread widely, quickly.

2. Involve Brand (If You Alter a Brand Color)

   > Brand colors are the brand team’s territory. So discuss adjustments with them and defer to their judgment as needed.

3. Drop the Neutral Neutrals

   > Provide a few light grays and a few dark grays to achieve useful 
   > contrast, but don’t get wishy washy wireframey. Consider avoiding medium grays in between.

4. Go “Digital Blue.” Everybody Else Does.

   >  When (not if ;) ) you go with your “Digital Blue,” choose an accessible
   >  one and make sure it doesn’t clash with the brand’s own blue, or red, 
   >  orange, purple, or green.



### Tints & Shades Per Color

5. Stack the Tint & Shade Range, Per Color

   > Stack available colors in each hue, and treat the stack as a visualization to include important details compactly.

6. Name Tints & Shades by Brightness

   > Scale color names between 0 and 100 based on brightness, such as 
   > $color-gray-05 and $color-gray-92. The scale reflects a familiar range 
   > from dark to light, allows for injecting new options between, and heck 
   > if I won’t remember $color-gray- 93 until we retire it later.

7. Limit Tint & Shade Quantity

   > Offer a handful of options and avoid tedious variety. Empower system 
   > users with just enough choice: more than a single option, but only up to
   >  a few intentional choices.

8. Tell Me How To Transform: Hand-Pick or Functionally

   > Deliberately allow — or avoid — color transformations in your system. If
   >  you endorse the practice, then offer examples of when and how to do it 
   > effectively in your system, such as 5–10% for moderately bright cases 
   > and 10–20% in more extreme cases. If transformations should be avoided , document that succinctly.



### Secondary Palettes

9. Define Meaningful Sets Like Feedback Colors

   > Explore and define the standard feedback colors and other relevant sets 
   > to ensure that colors fit harmoniously rather wedging them in later or 
   > having teammates recall “I just grabbed it from Google.”

10.  Illustrate Theme Variety

  > Reveal the range of themes available compactly, and set boundaries around allowable theme colors in certain contexts.

11. Identify how theming works,

    > particularly via reference to specific UI 
    > element properties in play. Just as important, articulate which — if not
    >  most — elements are off limits.

12. Avoid Guiding on Color-Mixing Until (At Least) Dust Settles

    > Avoid the rabbit hole of solving for a vast array of color combinations 
    > unless it’s a core system value. In most cases, system users will pair 
    > up their own combinations or benefit from a tool more dedicated to doing just that. Help them propagate their choice rather than solving for 
    > every combination they may consider. That experimentation is their job.



### Contrast & Accessibility

13. Check Contrast Early & Ritually

    > Any system designer responsible for color must be familiar with WCAG 2.0 rules, have a tool (like Tanaguru) to test color pairs, and incorporate
    >  the practice into color selection.

14. Explore Accessible Color Choices Across Ranges

    > When exploring accessible color contrast, show a range of choices to help a team select a color that passes the test.

15. Solve the Reverse Light on Dark and Dark on Light

    > Solve for and recommend reversed pairings to adopt or avoid.

16. Use Color to Provoke Broader Accessibility Awareness

    > Seize the opportunity to advocate for accessibility. Always be probing a
    >  collaborator’s knowledge of accessibility (or lack thereof) and educate
    >  and advocate all you can.
