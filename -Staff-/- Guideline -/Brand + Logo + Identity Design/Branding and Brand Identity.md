# Branding and Brand Identity



## History



## Brand

##### What is a Brand ?

> Branding goes beyond a simple logo design, brochure, or website. It is a process that addresses the big ideas of successfully communicating a company's unique message.

> A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer's decision to choose one product or service over another. -- Seth Godin

> The brand is the promise,  reputation, and big idea. It is a highly valued asset. A brand creates emotional connections, good or bad. We respond to brands with loyalty, or reject them.

Example : 



##### What makes a brand ?

Every point of contact a consumer has with a company reinforces the brand perception. every interaction with a brand adds to this perception, and this response changes with each point of contact.

1. Actions 

   > The Company Actions. Is the company engaged in sustainable practices, or are they burning rainforests? In today's market, the consumer is especially aware of the ethical conduct of a company.

2. Product 

   > Is the product useful and made with quality, or is it a badly manufactured knockoff?

3. Customer service

   > Does the customer receive courteous and efficient service?

4. Logo

5. Visuals

   > Are they clear and professional, or convoluted and in disarray?

6. Expectations

   > Does the product or experience meet or surpass what I expected?

7. Reputation

8. Employees

   > people are aware of companies with discriminatory practices or bad working conditions.



A brand will always be either positive or negative. It will be clear or confused, or it will be friendly or hostile.



The logo, for example, is the entry point to the brand. or places where the consumer comes into contact with the brand.



##### The visuals

1. Logo

   > The logo is the entry point to the brand. It's the visual expression of a brand's identity and values. It's shorthand, and it tells the viewer who is speaking, and what they believe. It doesn't describe the client's business, it identifies it.

2. Identity System

3. Printed matter

4. Website

5. Broadcast

6. Signage



The visual system is the kit of parts that give the client a proprietary look. Being consistent with typography, color, images, and style, helps the viewer identify the brand quickly. This also reinforces the brand message.

The goal is to combine all these elements. The logo, color palette, typography, images, and style, with the right words to communicate a clear message. If it's done well, I should be able to know what the brand is without seeing the name or logo. The process will require frequent check-in with the client. This is collaboration between you and the client. Ongoing communication and review of alternative ideas helps guide the solution to the right message.



##### Brand Identity

When we talk about strategy in the context of design, we are talking about communication strategy. What is the client saying, to whom, and how?



## Strategy

##### What to know

1. I want to know what the current brand strategy is, if there is one. If so, 
2. what does the client think works and what doesn't? This isn't about the visuals, it's about the message. 
3. What does the client believe he or she is communicating? I need to understand the audience. Who is the current audience and who do they want it to be?  The chances are good that there is a primary and secondary audience.
4. Now, who should it be in five years? Will that audience stay with the brand or do they need to expand or contract? 
5. Who is the client's competition? Is there anyone else doing exactly the same thing? Are they more successful or gaining from behind? What is their brand message? Go beyond the expected. One of my clients was a nonprofit library foundation. The obvious competition was bookstores and online books.
6. need to know about the current brand strategy, competition, audience, goals, strengths and weaknesses. 
7. I need to learn about the client's competition. This gave us great insight about the competitions, communications, and responses. Identifying the correct audience is critical. Surgical marketing with clear messages can only happen when you know whom you are trying to reach.
8. what are the company's primary values? What are the company's strengths and weaknesses? What message is the company communicating now? What should the company be communicating?
9. Who is the company's primary audience and stakeholders? Who should the audience be? Who is the primary competition? Remember, it's your job to gather the information, not disagree or argue. This is the chance for the client to do all the talking. Now it's time for how. How does the company reach the current audience? How does the company define itself to the outside world? How does the company communicate its values to the employees? Each of these questions could be broken into more detailed ones.

The point, here, is not to open the dialogue for a complain fest. It's to find the areas that are working, and those that can be improved. 



##### Problem solving

Now that I've gathered interviews, research, analytical data and existing visual material, it's time to do the hard work. It's time to solve the problem

 Make lists of all the answers and eliminate the duplicates. Even if they aren't true, these are the perceptions. What message is the company communicating now? And what should the company be communicating? What does the visual collateral say? Is it clear or confused? Is there a message or just a mess? Do the logo's color, typography and image reinforce what the client thinks he or she is communicating? If not, you need to be able to show how it isn't.

You've pulled together the information that points to an answer with the values, strengths, weaknesses and message. 



##### determine a strategy for the communication and visual direction. 

Who is the company's primary audience and stakeholders? I compare the answers I have from my interviews with the analytical research from data. The answers maybe 100% correct but if they are different than the reality, again, I need to show facts to prove this.

Who should the audience be? The answer is based on the CEO's goals. It may take some work to move out of everyone. You might break the audience into the different groups. The core group, secondary and general public. However, if he or she wants the audience to be only men with an eye patch, then it's my job to learn what that audience values and how to reach them. You're free to have an opinion here, you're an expert not a doormat. You can certainly suggest that this group might be too narrow but it's the client's company and goals.

Who is the company's primary competition? The answer to this will come from the interviews and your own research. Who is the most direct and current competition? Who is the next level out? And who is a minimal threat? Now, it's time for how. How does the company reach the current audience? You've gathered the visual collateral and looked at all the touch points. This is a list of those. There are probably some that the client hasn't considered. Remember to include all social media even if it's not coming directly from the client but secondhand.

How does the company define itself to the outside world? The answer here is more about the primary media than the message. Does the company define itself through the web and a magazine? Is it a mix of media? What media fits the company's goals best? If it's a non-profit helping homeless people, the internet may not be the best media for those without access. Perhaps inexpensive newsletters are a better choice. How does the company communicate its values to the internal audience? Many times a client forgets to talk with the internal audience,the employees and business partners.

But this is as important as the external audience. If I think I work for a company that cares about homeowners' financial stability and Joe thinks we are a car loan company, the message we tell and the choices we make will be out of sync with the vision. Does the internal audience have a place to go online to learn about the goals and vision? Is there any training or a manual? In the end, you won't have one clear answer for all of these questions. They can be subjective.

You will, however, have the tools needed to make choices about the design solution and media to use. You can use this information to back up your work with hard facts.



##### Presentation

 It's about convincing someone that your solution is the right one.  Most of our clients rely on facts and figures to make decisions. So we need to create a logical presentation in their language.

Someone with little knowledge of the project may look at it and have questions. Design the presentation with this in mind. Make it understandable to a child. Restate the assignment. I find it useful to provide the question someone may be asking and then answer it. List your research questions. Who, how, and what on individual pages. 

Now answer the questions the same way, on individual pages. Give the viewer time to let the information sink in. Keep the answers as simple as possible. You can present the backup information of research and interviews at the end of the document. Add your list of five to eight words to describe the values. Before this point, you should have finalized these with the CEO and anyone else involved. If answers are complicated,it's a good idea to use diagrams.

Everyone is visual. Even mathematicians live in a world of television, movies, and advertising. It may be clearer to show the audience in a visual rather than a paragraph. Incorporate other visuals to clarify your findings. Don't list the competition, use the logos. Show all of the current visual material you've collected on one page. This is a good way to see the breadth of the work at once, something clients rarely do.

Typically, the materials won't feel like a common and consistent family. That's not apparent until the client sees it as a whole. Remember, someone in the room, or who might see the document later, probably had a hand in some of the existing materials. It's a good idea to not say,"Boy this is ugly." Find a positive attribute. And finally, add a call to action. Tell the client what should happen. The next step is to take this information and proceed to the design studies.

And remember to end with a page that says, "Thank you."



## Identity systems

An identity system is the combination of all the pieces that work together maintaining a singular voice for the brand. logo, color palette, color palette, image style, choice of materials, and copy style.

Maintaining an identity system, and brand message, will lead to easy recognition by the audience. 



## The rules of logo design

I share logos with the client on every presentation. 

First, good logos identify, they do not describe. The most successful logos tell me who the brand is, not what it does. This like your name.

> I know you might be Jane, but that doesn't tell me whether you're nice or a jerk. This is tricky, most clients want a logo that shows what they do, or what product they make. But consider Apple, if the logo was a little illustration of the first Macintosh, they could never venture into iTunes,iPhones, and all the other products that are now part of the Apple family. By remaining neutral and focusing on a clear identifier, the client can evolve and grow in any direction.

Second, a logo cannot solve every problem. As we discussed previously, the logo is there to reinforce the brand message. 

> It can't fix a company's profits if the distribution process in shipping is flawed. A logo is a good Armani suit, it makes me look professional, well-groomed, and confident, but can't help me if I have an awful personality. 

Third, the logo must be visually engaging. This is true for all design. The logo must be strong and clear.

Fourth, the logo must have mnemonic value. It must be memorable. 

> One of the best tools to achieve this is to pose a question. Not, "What is the meaning of life?" But something as simple as, "Why is the "o" in Mobil red?" This engages the viewer, and the more time someone spends pondering, even an unconscious question, the more memorable the logo.

> Another tool is to let something read two ways. Once someone sees the arrow in the FedEx logo, they never forget it. 

Fifth, the logo must be able to exist in a variety of media. 

Sixth, a logo is not an illustration. 

Seven, a logo is the foundation of the visual system. The logo is the entry point to the brand message, but the entire identity system is the whole story. 

How does it work in a letterhead, brochure, or packaging?



## Wordmarks

A wordmark is just that, a word that is a mark. It's the company name typeset in a proprietary way and used consistently.

> such as Ford, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Facebook. Coca-Cola,

The upside of a wordmark is that it is easy to identify. 

The downside is that it relies on reading. It may not be easily understood in other languages, like Chinese or Arabic.

A wordmark must be unique enough to discourage civilians from trying to make it alone. A good wordmark isn't simply typeset. It should be a proprietary set of letter forms easy to read and memorable.

The wordmark is not a typeset word. It's an icon of a name. The letter forms in a successful wordmark have been modified to read faster. 

The point is to create an iconic representation of the name that expresses the brand attributes.



## Monogram

 A monogram is simply the initial of a company or, at times, a single letter. This is a good solution if the client has a long and unwieldy name.

> IBM was originally International Business Machines
>
> NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
>
> MTV, Music Television,
>
> ABC is the American Broadcasting Company.

The downside of a monogram is the ubiquity of acronyms in the world. 





## Icons

Icons are logos that rely on symbolism. They work when we understand what they mean and whom they belong to.They are incredibly powerful, and cross cultures and languages.

> Apple logo

Icons that have succeeded took years of repeated exposure before they could stand on their own. The Apple logo was connected to the Apple name for two decades before the icon was recognizable enough to drop the word-mark.

An icon is not an illustration. It is a symbol that will need to reproduce in all media. It should relate to the brand message. 

These may have communicated the idea abstractly, but were so ubiquitous that the audience didn't see them. 

When the solution is an icon, I suggest that we link the name to the symbol for at least a few years. This gives the audience a chance to recognize it. 

Branding is about communicating the message. That takes time, and typically, repeated exposure. 





## Logo

Logo: a wordmark, monogram, icon, or combination of two

The logo is the final form the audience should see. It's the formal wear of the identity system. Combining an icon and wordmark, as we've explored, reinforces the connection and recognition. (NBC, UPS)

> The point of understanding the terminology of branding is not to create a complex new language. There are so many misunderstood terms, that it's important to make sure you and your client are talking about the same thing. Take a few moments and explain your understanding of each term.
