# the Basics of Proofreading 

https://www.designersinsights.com/designer-resources/learning-the-basics-of-proofreading/

Learning how to properly use and understand proofreader’s marks and 
symbols is essential, since these are internationally-recognized 
standards used to mark changes and revisions on a typographic proof. 
Changes should be marked in red or any other contrasting color on a 
hardcopy proof or by using Adobe Acrobat Professional 'comments and 
markup' tools.            



### the marked-up proof example

# The Basics



## Font Formats

A digital font file contains information that describes the characteristics of a font and determines how it looks on screen and when printed. There are different formats for digital fonts based on the 
capabilities of the operating system and the technologies being used to describe the letter-forms.         

### TrueType (.ttf)

TrueType, designed by Apple Computer, is now used by both Apple and Microsoft in their operating systems. It is a scalable outline format created to replace the bitmap fonts previously used for screen display.

**TTF** : Works in most browsers except IE and Iphone.  replaced by WOFF



### OpenType (.otf)

The OpenType font format was developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe. It is an extension of TrueType that adds support for PostScript font data. The main advantages of OpenType are:

- Broader multi-platform support: A single font file works on both PCs and Macs.
- Better language support: OpenType fonts include the standard range of Latin characters and many international characters.
- Advanced typography features: An OpenType font file can contain many non-standard glyphs such as old-style figures, true small capitals, fractions, swashes, superiors, inferiors, titling letters, and a full range of ligatures.



### Embedded OpenType (.eot)

EOT is supported exclusively by Internet Explorer versions 8.x and lower. EOT fonts’ digital rights management technique prevents them from being copied and used without a license.

**EOT** : IE only.  only necessary for IE older than IE9



### Web Open Font Format (.woff)

WOFF is a wrapper that contains TrueType and OpenType fonts with additional metadata. It is in the process of being standardized as a recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Fonts Working Group.

**WOFF** : Compressed , emerging standard. works in all modern browsers



### SVG

SVG fonts describe glyph outlines as vector objects, which usually results in larger file sizes. SVG is the only format that can be used for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch prior to iOS 4.2.

**SVG** : Ipnone / Ipad. No longer supported or required for any browser

### How will you use the font?



## Anti-aliasing

Certain adaptations of anti-aliasing can enhance both the legibility and aesthetics of on-screen type, though not in every case

Aliasing and Anti-aliasing:

![Aliasing and Anti-aliasing](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Aliasing and Anti-aliasing.gif)

#### TIP

Type sizes of 14 points and up usually can be anti-aliased quite successfully. Around 12 points, it depends very much on the weight and design of the typeface. Below that, it’s much better to use a properly designed screen font without anti-aliasing.

![Regular (Aliasing) and Anti-aliasing comparisons](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Regular (Aliasing) and Anti-aliasing comparisons.png)





## Font-size Measurement

The standard unit to measure font height in the print world is the point. In the web world, in addition to the point (pt), there are many other ways to measure font sizes. These can be categorized into two groups: fixed-height measurements and relative font measurements.



### Fixed-height Measurement

- *points (pt)*
- *picas (pc)*
- *inches (in)*
- *centimeters (cm)*
- *millimeters (mm)*

>     1 pt = 1/72 of an inch  
>
>     1 pc = 12 pts

[Inches, points, and picas comparisons]

![Inches, points, and picas comparisons](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Inches, points, and picas comparisons.png)

Two other fixed-height measurements are available for the web only:

- *X-height (ex)*    Based on the height of the lowercase x character
- *Pixels (px)*    Based on the resolution of the screen. 

[Definition of ex]

![Definition of ex](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Definition of ex.png)

Using fixed-height measurement on the web is not recommended because the web usually is viewed on screen, and different screens have different resolutions. When you specify 14-point type, it might display much larger or smaller than you expect on different screens. This is most commonly noticed when moving between Windows and Macintosh computers: type typically displays almost 25% smaller on the Mac.

Thus, a better way to set font-size on the web is to use relative font measurement.



### Relative Font Measurement

- *Ems (em)*    Based on the default font size in the viewer's browser.
- *Percentages (%)*    Like ems, based on the default preferences of the browser, and calculated relative to the surrounding text.

> 1 em = 16 px (the default font-size of most browsers)*

#### TIP

Think in Pixels, use Ems for the measure. 

Font sizes are inherited within the [DOM](http://www.w3schools.com/htmldom/default.asp) by children from their parent elements. This can make em sizing 
calculations for nested elements difficult. A good idea is to size everything in pixels first and then convert the measurements over to 
ems. 



### Composing to a Scale

#### TIP

A good rule of thumb is to select a comfortable size for type: 14pixels and up. Use scales to differentiate headlines, body copy, footers, side notes, and other text-based information.

[Example of the classical scale]

![the classical scale](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/the classical scale.png)

[Example of scale based on the Fibonacci sequence]

![scale based on the Fibonacci sequence](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/scale based on the Fibonacci sequence.png)

Once the body text size is determined, the sizes of the other type can be selected within the scale to create hierarchy. The em relationships among different type sizes are also based on where they are on a scale.



### More about Em 

Em measures relative sizing and can be specified to three decimal places—for example, 1.375em. It is calculated based on the font-size of the parent element.

Here is the formula to convert pixels to em:

> required pixel value ÷ parent font-size = em value

For example, the h1 font-size is  18 pixels. To convert it into em,  18 ÷ 16 = 1.125em (16 pixel is the default body font-size). 



## Legibility and Readability

Legibility and readability are very important concepts in typography, and the two are often confused.

#### Legibility

Legibility is a measure of how easy it is to distinguish one letter from another in a particular typeface. Usually it’s primarily the concern of the typeface designer, who should ensure that each individual character or glyph is unambiguous and distinguishable from all others in the font. Legibility is also about choosing the right typeface at the right size.

#### Readability

Readability can be defined not on a letter-by-letter basis, but by how the combinations of letters are read within a larger body of text. In other words, readability is defined by how easy it is to read words, phrases, or blocks of copy such as a book, a web page, or an article.

Legibility refers to perception; readability refers to comprehension. They both are determined by font choice, sizing, spacing, and text alignment. 



[Readable Type]

![Readable Type](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Readable Type.png)

[Legible Type]

![Legible Type](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Legible Type.png)

When reaching the end of the line on the top paragraph, it is easier to identify the correct next line in the preceding text. The paragraph below causes some difficulty in finding the next line even though the letters themselves are easier to understand. The first block of text demonstrates readable type, while the second shows legible type.



## Hierarchy

Any page of text starts out as a solid block of type. Barring intervention, the reader will start at the top left and work down to the bottom right—so there is a natural flow there from the beginning. However, the designer can present the text in a logical manner to make it easier for people to find the information they need.

Prioritizing information successfully is one of typographic design’s most essential functions. The designer can treat type differently to affect how the viewer reads and perceives the text on a website.

> The ordering system, or hierarchy, defines the level of activity and importance for every visual element and determines their sequence through the design.

All elements on a website cannot be visually equal. To create visual hierarchy is to establish emphasis and contrast. The level of attention a specific element can demand from a user is often referred to as “ **visual weight**”.

[Equal emphasis with everything]

[+color, space, position variations]

![+ color, space, position variations ](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/+ color, space, position variations .gif)



#### Hierarchical Development Process    

1. Rank the text by importance. Simply put, the designer must determine what he or she wants the viewer to see first, second, third, and so on.
2. Create a clear focal point. The dominant element is the focal point. Usually it will reside in the foreground (the area appears to be closest to the viewer) and demand attention. 
3. Use subordinate visual elements  to support the focal point. The subordinate visual elements will activate the middle ground or background in support of the dominant elements. The combination allows for in-depth interpretation and understanding of the message.  



#### Typographic Factors

Changing or adjusting one or several of the following typographic factors can effectively shift the visual weight between different type elements:

- [font size](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/measure.html)
- [font face](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/choosetype.html)
- [font style](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/weight.html)
- [font weight](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/weight.html)
- [color](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/choosecolor.html)
- [position](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/indent.html)
- [surrounding space](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/margin.html)

Some strategies to create typographical hierarchy work well in print but are not ideal on the web. Examples of this include italics, underlining, and change of orientation.

Although italics often are used in printed matter to give emphasis, they pixelate horribly on a computer screen. They clash with the natural square pixel grid and are best avoided on web pages, especially at smaller sizes in a condensed space.

Underlining has a special meaning on a web page. It indicates a hypertext link, so it really is not a good idea to use underlining for any other purpose lest the reader be confused.

A line of type that is upside-down on a page is very noticeable, but also is difficult to read. On a printed page the reader could simply turn the page around, but that’s not quite so easy with a desktop computer.

# Typeface



## Typeface vs. Font

The terms typeface and font often are confused. Here are some explanations of the differences between the two.

### Typeface

A typeface is a design created by a typographer or type designer. It incorporates the specific letter-forms that include the variations of stroke weight, the forms of serifs, the counter shapes, the finial styles, the lengths of ascenders and descenders, and any other characteristics that differ from one type design to another.

Designers choose typefaces to create their projects. Each typeface is known by a name, such as Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman, etc. The term “typeface” originated from movable type, whose blocks of wood or metal each contain a relief image of a character on one surface (the “face”).

### Font

A font is the digital representation of a typeface. It is a collection of all the characters of a typeface in one size (12pt/1in) and one style (bold/italic). For example, Arial in 12pt size is a font, Arial in 18pt size is a font, and Arial  bold in 24pt is also a font. Adobe's type glossary lists a font as “one weight, width, and style of a typeface.”

### Type Family

The complete assembly of all sizes and styles of one typeface forms a type family. Web designers sometimes refer to it as a “font family” because that is the name of the CSS declaration. Usually the type family has the same name as the typeface. A type family may contain many variations, but all variations are based on common design characteristics. For example, the Caslon family consists of styles such as Roman (Regular), Italic, Semibold, Semibold Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic. Each of the style and weight combinations is a typeface, and together they form a type family.

![anatomy](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/anatomy.png)





## Weight and Style

The weight of a particular font is the thickness of the character outlines relative to their height. A typeface may come in many weights, from ultra-light to  extra-bold or black. Four to six weights are not unusual, and a few  typefaces have as many as a dozen [fig.1].

In CSS, you can specify font-weights other than normal and bold [by using numeric font-weight values](http://help.typekit.com/customer/portal/articles/6855-using-multiple-weights-and-styles) scaled from 100 to 900 (400 is the same as normal, and 700 is the same as bold).

The style of a font is usually connected to an angle. It is either upright or slanted. The normal style is upright or roman and  will display by default.

Many font families have an **italics** version of the font. The italic font style of a typeface has been slanted to the right and has had other changes made to the letter glyphs to make them slightly different. It approaches a more handwritten, cursive style. Sometimes the characters may even connect.

Oblique font faces are found in many sans-serif typefaces. Their characters are also slanted but, unlike italics, the glyphs themselves are not changed. Oblique fonts are not true italics because they lack the change in letter shapes which is part of the definition of “italic” [fig.2].

Effectively using variations of  weight and style can help to create [visual hierarchy](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/hierarchy.html).
