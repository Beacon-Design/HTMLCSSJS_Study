# the Basics of Proofreading 

https://www.designersinsights.com/designer-resources/learning-the-basics-of-proofreading/

Learning how to properly use and understand proofreader’s marks and 
symbols is essential, since these are internationally-recognized 
standards used to mark changes and revisions on a typographic proof. 
Changes should be marked in red or any other contrasting color on a 
hardcopy proof or by using Adobe Acrobat Professional 'comments and 
markup' tools.

# The Basics



## Font Formats

A digital font file contains information that describes the characteristics of a font and determines how it looks on screen and when printed. There are different formats for digital fonts based on the 
capabilities of the operating system and the technologies being used to describe the letter-forms.         

### TrueType (.ttf)

TrueType, designed by Apple Computer, is now used by both Apple and Microsoft in their operating systems. It is a scalable outline format created to replace the bitmap fonts previously used for screen display.

**TTF** : Works in most browsers except IE and Iphone.  replaced by WOFF



### OpenType (.otf)

The OpenType font format was developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe. It is an extension of TrueType that adds support for PostScript font data. The main advantages of OpenType are:

- Broader multi-platform support: A single font file works on both PCs and Macs.
- Better language support: OpenType fonts include the standard range of Latin characters and many international characters.
- Advanced typography features: An OpenType font file can contain many non-standard glyphs such as old-style figures, true small capitals, fractions, swashes, superiors, inferiors, titling letters, and a full range of ligatures.



### Embedded OpenType (.eot)

EOT is supported exclusively by Internet Explorer versions 8.x and lower. EOT fonts’ digital rights management technique prevents them from being copied and used without a license.

**EOT** : IE only.  only necessary for IE older than IE9



### Web Open Font Format (.woff)

WOFF is a wrapper that contains TrueType and OpenType fonts with additional metadata. It is in the process of being standardized as a recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Fonts Working Group.

**WOFF** : Compressed , emerging standard. works in all modern browsers



### SVG

SVG fonts describe glyph outlines as vector objects, which usually results in larger file sizes. SVG is the only format that can be used for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch prior to iOS 4.2.

**SVG** : Ipnone / Ipad. No longer supported or required for any browser

### How will you use the font?



## Anti-aliasing

Certain adaptations of anti-aliasing can enhance both the legibility and aesthetics of on-screen type, though not in every case

Aliasing and Anti-aliasing:

![Aliasing and Anti-aliasing](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Aliasing and Anti-aliasing.gif)

#### TIP

Type sizes of 14 points and up usually can be anti-aliased quite successfully. Around 12 points, it depends very much on the weight and design of the typeface. Below that, it’s much better to use a properly designed screen font without anti-aliasing.



Regular (Aliasing) and Anti-aliasing comparisons:

![Regular (Aliasing) and Anti-aliasing comparisons](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Regular (Aliasing) and Anti-aliasing comparisons.png)





## Font-size Measurement

The standard unit to measure font height in the print world is the point. In the web world, in addition to the point (pt), there are many other ways to measure font sizes. These can be categorized into two groups: fixed-height measurements and relative font measurements.



### Fixed-height Measurement

- *points (pt)*
- *picas (pc)*
- *inches (in)*
- *centimeters (cm)*
- *millimeters (mm)*

>     1 pt = 1/72 of an inch  
>
>     1 pc = 12 pts

[Inches, points, and picas comparisons]

![Inches, points, and picas comparisons](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Inches, points, and picas comparisons.png)

Two other fixed-height measurements are available for the web only:

- *X-height (ex)*    Based on the height of the lowercase x character
- *Pixels (px)*    Based on the resolution of the screen. 

[Definition of ex]

![Definition of ex](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Definition of ex.png)

Using fixed-height measurement on the web is not recommended because the web usually is viewed on screen, and different screens have different resolutions. When you specify 14-point type, it might display much larger or smaller than you expect on different screens. This is most commonly noticed when moving between Windows and Macintosh computers: type typically displays almost 25% smaller on the Mac.

Thus, a better way to set font-size on the web is to use relative font measurement.



### Relative Font Measurement

- *Ems (em)*    Based on the default font size in the viewer's browser.
- *Percentages (%)*    Like ems, based on the default preferences of the browser, and calculated relative to the surrounding text.

> 1 em = 16 px (the default font-size of most browsers)*

#### TIP

Think in Pixels, use Ems for the measure. 

Font sizes are inherited within the [DOM](http://www.w3schools.com/htmldom/default.asp) by children from their parent elements. This can make em sizing 
calculations for nested elements difficult. A good idea is to size everything in pixels first and then convert the measurements over to 
ems. 



### Composing to a Scale

#### TIP

A good rule of thumb is to select a comfortable size for type: 14pixels and up. Use scales to differentiate headlines, body copy, footers, side notes, and other text-based information.

[Example of the classical scale]

![the classical scale](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/the classical scale.png)

[Example of scale based on the Fibonacci sequence]

![scale based on the Fibonacci sequence](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/scale based on the Fibonacci sequence.png)

Once the body text size is determined, the sizes of the other type can be selected within the scale to create hierarchy. The em relationships among different type sizes are also based on where they are on a scale.



### More about Em 

Em measures relative sizing and can be specified to three decimal places—for example, 1.375em. It is calculated based on the font-size of the parent element.

Here is the formula to convert pixels to em:

> required pixel value ÷ parent font-size = em value

For example, the h1 font-size is  18 pixels. To convert it into em,  18 ÷ 16 = 1.125em (16 pixel is the default body font-size). 



## Legibility and Readability

Legibility and readability are very important concepts in typography, and the two are often confused.

#### Legibility

Legibility is a measure of how easy it is to distinguish one letter from another in a particular typeface. Usually it’s primarily the concern of the typeface designer, who should ensure that each individual character or glyph is unambiguous and distinguishable from all others in the font. Legibility is also about choosing the right typeface at the right size.

#### Readability

Readability can be defined not on a letter-by-letter basis, but by how the combinations of letters are read within a larger body of text. In other words, readability is defined by how easy it is to read words, phrases, or blocks of copy such as a book, a web page, or an article.

Legibility refers to perception; readability refers to comprehension. They both are determined by font choice, sizing, spacing, and text alignment. 



[Readable Type]

![Readable Type](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Readable Type.png)

[Legible Type]

![Legible Type](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/Legible Type.png)

When reaching the end of the line on the top paragraph, it is easier to identify the correct next line in the preceding text. The paragraph below causes some difficulty in finding the next line even though the letters themselves are easier to understand. The first block of text demonstrates readable type, while the second shows legible type.



## Hierarchy

Any page of text starts out as a solid block of type. Barring intervention, the reader will start at the top left and work down to the bottom right—so there is a natural flow there from the beginning. However, the designer can present the text in a logical manner to make it easier for people to find the information they need.

Prioritizing information successfully is one of typographic design’s most essential functions. The designer can treat type differently to affect how the viewer reads and perceives the text on a website.

> The ordering system, or hierarchy, defines the level of activity and importance for every visual element and determines their sequence through the design.

All elements on a website cannot be visually equal. To create visual hierarchy is to establish emphasis and contrast. The level of attention a specific element can demand from a user is often referred to as “ **visual weight**”.

[Equal emphasis with everything]

[+color, space, position variations]

![+ color, space, position variations ](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/+ color, space, position variations .gif)



#### Hierarchical Development Process    

1. Rank the text by importance. Simply put, the designer must determine what he or she wants the viewer to see first, second, third, and so on.
2. Create a clear focal point. The dominant element is the focal point. Usually it will reside in the foreground (the area appears to be closest to the viewer) and demand attention. 
3. Use subordinate visual elements  to support the focal point. The subordinate visual elements will activate the middle ground or background in support of the dominant elements. The combination allows for in-depth interpretation and understanding of the message.  



#### Typographic Factors

Changing or adjusting one or several of the following typographic factors can effectively shift the visual weight between different type elements:

- [font size](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/measure.html)
- [font face](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/choosetype.html)
- [font style](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/weight.html)
- [font weight](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/weight.html)
- [color](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/choosecolor.html)
- [position](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/indent.html)
- [surrounding space](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/margin.html)

Some strategies to create typographical hierarchy work well in print but are not ideal on the web. Examples of this include italics, underlining, and change of orientation.

Although italics often are used in printed matter to give emphasis, they pixelate horribly on a computer screen. They clash with the natural square pixel grid and are best avoided on web pages, especially at smaller sizes in a condensed space.

Underlining has a special meaning on a web page. It indicates a hypertext link, so it really is not a good idea to use underlining for any other purpose lest the reader be confused.

A line of type that is upside-down on a page is very noticeable, but also is difficult to read. On a printed page the reader could simply turn the page around, but that’s not quite so easy with a desktop computer.

# Typeface



## Typeface vs. Font

The terms typeface and font often are confused. Here are some explanations of the differences between the two.

### Typeface

A typeface is a design created by a typographer or type designer. It incorporates the specific letter-forms that include the variations of stroke weight, the forms of serifs, the counter shapes, the finial styles, the lengths of ascenders and descenders, and any other characteristics that differ from one type design to another.

Designers choose typefaces to create their projects. Each typeface is known by a name, such as Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman, etc. The term “typeface” originated from movable type, whose blocks of wood or metal each contain a relief image of a character on one surface (the “face”).

### Font

A font is the digital representation of a typeface. It is a collection of all the characters of a typeface in one size (12pt/1in) and one style (bold/italic). For example, Arial in 12pt size is a font, Arial in 18pt size is a font, and Arial  bold in 24pt is also a font. Adobe's type glossary lists a font as “one weight, width, and style of a typeface.”

### Type Family

The complete assembly of all sizes and styles of one typeface forms a type family. Web designers sometimes refer to it as a “font family” because that is the name of the CSS declaration. Usually the type family has the same name as the typeface. A type family may contain many variations, but all variations are based on common design characteristics. For example, the Caslon family consists of styles such as Roman (Regular), Italic, Semibold, Semibold Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic. Each of the style and weight combinations is a typeface, and together they form a type family.



[anatomy]

![anatomy](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/anatomy.png)





## Weight and Style

The weight of a particular font is the thickness of the character outlines relative to their height. A typeface may come in many weights, from ultra-light to  extra-bold or black. Four to six weights are not unusual, and a few  typefaces have as many as a dozen [fig.1].

In CSS, you can specify font-weights other than normal and bold [by using numeric font-weight values](http://help.typekit.com/customer/portal/articles/6855-using-multiple-weights-and-styles) scaled from 100 to 900 (400 is the same as normal, and 700 is the same as bold).

The style of a font is usually connected to an angle. It is either upright or slanted. The normal style is upright or roman and  will display by default.

Many font families have an **italics** version of the font. The italic font style of a typeface has been slanted to the right and has had other changes made to the letter glyphs to make them slightly different. It approaches a more handwritten, cursive style. Sometimes the characters may even connect.

Oblique font faces are found in many sans-serif typefaces. Their characters are also slanted but, unlike italics, the glyphs themselves are not changed. Oblique fonts are not true italics because they lack the change in letter shapes which is part of the definition of “italic” [fig.2].

Effectively using variations of  weight and style can help to create [visual hierarchy](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/hierarchy.html).

## Choose the Right Typeface

Think less of styles,  but more of readability when choosing a typeface for body copy, and pick a typeface that works well in small sizes. The best way to decide on one is to try out each typeface that might work, then compare and decide. 

**TIP**

There are some guiding principles and characteristics that can be considered while choosing a readable on-screen typeface:

1. Tall x-height, and average length of ascenders and descenders. [fig.1]
2. Slightly wider em width, and medium height-to-width ratio. [fig.2]
3. Small variations in stroke weight. [fig.3]
4. Avoid overlarge counters. [fig.4]
5. Choose a face with familiar letter forms. Avoid quirky typefaces that break convention.
6. Use lower case letters with capitals where appropriate.
7. Serifs for larger type, and sans-serif for smaller type.

CSS font specifications should always include a list of fonts that different browsers can use. This way, if the first font chosen is unavailable, the browser will move on to the second choice, and so on through the list.

> A Font Stack is a list of fonts in a CSS font-family declaration.

A font stack usually contains 4 to 6 fonts. Their order should be:

1. Preferred font.
2. Nearest alternative
3. OS alternative
4. The most common Mac or Windows fonts
5. Generic font name ([serif/sans-serif/cursive/monospace/fantasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_family_(HTML)#Generic_font_families)) [fig.5]

[Generic Font on Mac] 5

![enerictyp](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/generictype.png)

With CSS Font Embedding, the web designer is no longer  stuck with the [standard web-safe font](http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html). Simply use the @font-face rule within the CSS stylesheet, name it using CSS's standard font-family property, give it a source URL (the location of the font file on the server), and refer to it just as  any other font throughout the rest of the CSS. 

One issue with font embedding is  browser compatibility with the [font format.](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/format.html#browser) 



## How to Combine Typefaces

Combining typefaces is not an easy task. Unless there's a very good reason to use more, fewer is always better. Usually a good strategy is to use one or two type families to get the most impact in the design, and to create visual hierarchy with various type styles, scales, and colors. Here are some strategies and principles to follow to combine typefaces.



#### Family Comes First

Many text can be set beautifully in only one typeface. The safest bet in creating continuity in visual form is to rely on a single large type family. A large type family provides a range of versatility with various weights and styles while sharing a consistent structure. 



#### Combine Typefaces from Different Classifications

Use multiple type families provides a broader typographic palette. Not only does it help to create hierarchy, but it also enhances the typographic color, rhythm, and texture of the design. 

Combing typefaces from different classifications, such as a serif and a sans-serif or a serif and a script, is a good strategy for producing a mixture that has proper contrast and yet doesn't clash. 

To look for compatible typefaces from different classifications, the designer needs to pay attention to the letter-forms, the mood inherent in the typeface, the weight, and the proportion. 

The **letter-forms** that make up a typeface can be incredibly varied based on a number of factors, such as historical influence or overall style. **One of the quickest ways to check compatible letter-forms is to check the letters a, g (single-story or double-story), e, t, and f**  [fig.1]. Differences in letter-forms are not necessarily a deal-breaker in typeface choices, but more similarities than differences is usually preferred. 

[Look at these letters first while checking for compatible letter-forms between typefaces]

![etterform](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/letterforms.png)

Typefaces are not just forms, they also have **personalities**. One common typographic mistake is not recognizing the inherent mood of a typeface. Select typefaces that have not only similar moods, but also moods that match the project  [fig.2]. 

[The inherent mood of typefaces]

![ontmoo](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/fontmood.png)

**Proportion** is probably the most important thing to consider, especially when combining typefaces in a single line (such as in a header or logo). Their respective x-heights should be close to the same size, the ascenders and descenders should be about the same length and the general width of the characters should be similar  [fig.3]. 

[Things to check with letter proportions: x-height, width of the glyph, length of ascender/descender, and crossbar position. ]

![roportio](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/proportion.png)

#### Combine Typefaces from  Same Classification with Different Sub-Classes

When combining typefaces within the same classification (serif + serif, sans-serif + sans-serif), it is never a good idea to combine typefaces that look very similar in structure (for example, Times New Roman and Garamond). Something that almost matches looks like a mistake. The typefaces need to show  enough contrast so that they are immediately recognizable as different ones, while also share similar moods, structures, and other factors that tie them together. One trick is to choose typefaces that are in the same general classification but that fall under different sub-classes. For example, a slab serif pairs with a modern serif   [fig.4], or a geometric sans-serif pairs with a grotesque [fig.5]. This provides more contrast right from the start.

**TIP**

Combining typefaces should always keep at least one characteristics of the typefaces consistent, be it **proportion, weight, letterform, line quality, mood, or historical time period**. Hoefler & Frere-Jones has a great article about [ways to combine fonts](http://www.typography.com/email/2010_03/index.htm) in a design. The four tips are built around one principle:

> Keep one thing consistent, and let one thing vary

In all the effort to sort through large typeface libraries looking for just the right combination, it is often easy to overlook the sometimes obvious and much easier choices: 

- Use a classic sans-serif and serif combination. 
- Use typefaces that have neutral personalities (for example, Helvetica and Garamond)
- Use different font styles within the same font family.

# Spacing



## Margin and Padding

Margin and padding  both refer to white space around text or an image. In CSS, they are based on [the box model](http://www.redmelon.net/tstme/box_model/). The box model contains detailed options for adjusting margin, border, padding, and content for each element [fig.1].

[The Box Model]

![argi](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/margin.png)



Margin and padding provide a buffer between the main content and the supporting elements. Margin is used not only to bring  harmony between the text/image and its surroundings, but also to add visual interest by contrasting the positive space of the screen (text, images) with the negative (white) space [fig.2]. Balanced margin and padding spaces can provide visual breathing room to make the viewing experience more easy and effortless, and they provide unity throughout a site's pages by creating a consistent look and structure.

[Difference between Margin and Padding]

![argin](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/margin2.png)



**TIP**

Follow these guidelines to create harmonious proportion between text/image and its container:

- Give the text and its container the same shape.
- The content should have the same proportion, only smaller, as its container.
- A good margin ratio is 2 : 3 : 4 : 3 (top : right : bottom : left)
- Be generous with margin and padding spaces!      



**TIP**

Padding should always add up to the total width of the element. For example, if the element is 100px wide, and the left and right paddings are set to 10px each, then the total width ends up being 120px.

Margin, however, expands the box model but does not directly affect the element itself. This tip is especially handy when lining up columns in a layout.



## Line-height

Line-height is the vertical distance between lines of text. On the web, it is an equal amount of space above and below text on a line [fig.1]. Leading in desktop publishing, however, is the amount of space below a line of text. 

[Line-height definition]

![ineheight](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/lineheight1.png)



In CSS, the line-height property can take numeric or percentage values. If no line-height value is specified or inherited, the line-height by default is normal. It usually is about 20% larger than the font size. For example, if the font size is 14px, then the line-height is about 16.8px. With many font faces this Line-height is a little too small. The ideal Line-height varies depending on other typographic factors such as the choice of font face and line length [fig.2]. 

[Line-height and readability]

![pacing](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/spacing2.png)

**TIP**

Follow these general rules to set Line-height:

- The longer the line length, the taller the Line-height should be.*
- The shorter the line length, the shorter the Line-height should be. 
- Use a taller line-height with continuous copy. 
- Use taller line-heights with large x-height fonts. 
- The ascenders and descenders of the lines of text should not touch.
- Place the lines close enough together that the reader requires no effort to find the next line, then balance the height based on the line length.

With elastic layout, line-height along with font-size is better calculated with [em](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/measure.html). Because em is a relative measurement unit, it is based on the value of the parent element. 1.5em is the most common line-height; it states that this paragraph has a line-height of 150% of the current font-size (if the font-size is 12px, then the line-height is 1.5 × 12 = 18px).

\* Balanced line-height can be especially tricky to keep consistent in responsive layouts since line lengths will vary based on the width of the device. To solve this issue, the idea of fluid line-height — [Molten Leading](http://nicewebtype.com/notes/2012/02/03/molten-leading-or-fluid-line-height/) — was proposed. It allows line-height to change proportionally based on the screen width.   



## Letter-spacing

Letter-spacing is the same as *tracking* in desktop publishing. It's the amount of space between a group of letters. 

The amount of letter-spacing in text can affect readability. Tight letter-spacing, particularly in small text sizes, can be difficult to read. On the other hand, too much space to the point that individual letters become isolated can destroy readability as well.

In addition to Letter-spacing, word-spacing is another CSS property that can be specified to further tweak the text display. Word-spacing is the size of the space between words. By default, it is 0.25em.

On longer lines, a little extra word-spacing will mean fewer words per line, and thus make it easier for readers to keep track of where they are in the text. However, too much word-spacing breaks the line into separate elements, inhibiting reading. Word-spacing should always be less than line-spacing. Otherwise it makes reading difficult because the eye tends to move from top to bottom instead of left to right.  Word-spacing is also hugely influenced by [justification](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/alignment.html) (the text-align property in CSS). 

Using two spaces after a period—a habit that came from using the old monospaced typewriter—is inappropriate for the web. A page of text with two spaces between every sentence looks riddled with holes. Remember always to use one space between sentences.

Letter-spacing and word-spacing never should be considered in isolation. It is the combination of [line-height](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/lineheight.html), [font face](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/choosetype.html), [font-size](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/measure.html), [width of the text box](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/linelength.html), [white space surrounding the text](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/margin.html) and the letter- and word-spacing that gives the designer more accurate control over the word density, and thus the readability, of any given page.

# Paragraph



## Line Length

Line length, or measure, is an important factor that influences both aesthetics and readability. A line length that is too short causes the eye to jump too frequently from one line to the next. If it is too long, it causes the reader’s eye to double back.

**TIP**

An ideal line length is based on the [font-size](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/measure.html).  Robert Bringhurst suggests in *The Elements of Typographic Style* a line length of  45 to 75 characters.  

Line length also affects [Line-height](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/lineheight.html). The general rule is -

- The longer the line length, the taller the line-height should be.
- The shorter the line length, the shorter the line-height should be. 

Some designers use a *points-times-two* rule. Double the font-size to get the proper line length in picas. For example, if the font height is 11 points, then the line length is 22 picas or about 3.5".

The challenge of setting up line length on the web is how to establish a value that stays within the optimal range no matter what default font-size the user has set in their browser.

The width of a website layout can be either fixed (an absolute number) or flexible (a percentage). With fixed-width layout, the column width could be set based on the size of the font. If the font-size is set to 14 to 16 pixels, then the text column could be set  between 365 and 420 pixels wide. The challenge of flexible layout, however, is that the column width changes with the varying width of the browser window.

One solution is to set column width using the unit of [em](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/measure.html).

> In CSS, an em is a relative measure of length that inherits size information from parent elements.

If the parent element is body, then the size of the element is determined by the user's browser font settings. So using *em* as the unit to define text box width can ensure that the width always relates to the browser font-size.

## Alignment

Setting up text alignment is a fundamental typographic act. The four basic alignment types are: flush left, flush right, centered, and justified.

### Flush left/Ragged right

Text alignment in Web pages is, by default, to the left, with ragged edges on the right. In flush-left text the left margin is even and predictable and the right margin is irregular. It is the most legible option for web pages because word spaces are consistent, so there are no big holes inside the lines of text.

To work with flush left, the designer must pay attention to the appearance of the rag on the right edge. There should be no excessively long or short lines, and hyphenation should be kept to a minimum.

### Flush right/Ragged left

Flush right is the opposite of flush left. It forms a hard edge on the right, and leaves the left edge soft. It is difficult to read because it forces the reader’s eyes to start at a new position with each line. Flush right is not a good choice for use with long bodies of text. However, it can be used for sidebars, captions, marginal notes to suggest attraction among chunks of information, and usually when a small amount of text is meant to sit close to the right edge of a page or screen.

### Centered 

Centered alignment gives a formal and symmetrical impression. It is a good choice for invitations, titles, certificates, pull quotes, and other discrete pieces of information. However, it is difficult to read with long bodies of text. The ragged left margin of centered text makes scanning much harder because the reader must search for the beginning of each new line.

### Justified

Justified text is set flush with both the left and the right margins. It creates a solid rectangle on the page. It is the most popular alignment in newspapers and books because of its efficient use of space. It is easy to read and has a formal feeling.

However, when there is a line with a particularly small number of words, odd spaces can occur.  The white spaces throughout the text body are called “rivers”. In print, manually refined letter- and word-spacing and automatic hyphenation can adjust poor spacing. This level of control is difficult to achieve on web pages.

CSS3 has a text-justify property that aims to give the designer more control over text-align: justify. Currently it's  available only with IE. Firefox and Safari support the CSS3 property hyphens which allows hyphens being inserted into paragraphs automatically.

![lignmen](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/alignment.png)



## Vertical Rhythm

Rhythm is a repeated pattern. The more consistent the pattern, the better the rhythm. In print design, the designer uses a baseline grid to set type in order to create vertical rhythm and give unity to the design. The concept is similar on the web. As the viewer’s eye descends the page, everything should be lined up on an imaginary grid of evenly spaced horizontal lines. This improves readability and helps to make the layout harmonious and organized.

Vertical rhythm on the web is contributed to by font-size, line-height, and margin size.

### Set the Base Font-size and Line-height

The line-height is determined by the font-size of the body copy. If the base font-size is 12px or 0.75em (12 ÷ 16 = 0.75, 16px is the default browser font-size), then a proper line-height could be 0.75 × 1.5 = 1.125em (150% taller than the font-size, or 18px).

### Set the Space Between Paragraphs

The browser’s default value for spacing between paragraphs is 1em for both the top and bottom margins. If the rhythm of the page is to be maintained, the spacing of paragraphs should be related to the basic line-height unit. With the paragraph property <p>, the values of the top and bottom margins can be set equal to the line-height.

### Text Size Variations

Of course, not all text on a page will be the same size. The type in the heading may be larger, and that in the sidenotes may be smaller. To keep the vertical rhythm, the line-height will remain the same, but the margin will be adjusted accordingly.

FFollowing the previous example, if the sidebar font-size is set to 10px or 0.833em (10 ÷ 12 = 0.833; the default was set to 12px in the body property), then remember that margins relate to the font-size. The margin is to match the line-height of 18px, so the calculation is 18 ÷ 10 = 1.8.

The margins of the heading maybe a little trickier because it is more readable when the top margin is slightly larger so that there are more spaces between sections, and so that the bottom margin, where the heading relates to the following texts, is closer. A good approach to solving this problem is to take some space from the bottom margin and add that same amount to the top margin.

Based on the unified 18px line-height, the top margin of the heading can be 18 + 10 = 28px tall, and the bottom margin can be 18 – 10 = 8px wide.



[rhythm]

![hyth](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/rhythm.png)



## Indent and Space

There are several ways to separate paragraphs. The most common two are to indent the first line of paragraph, and to insert space between paragraphs.

**TIP**

Use only  ONE method to serve the purpose of separating paragraphs. Doing both is redundant and creates awkward, irregular chunks of white space in the text block.

### Indent

Typically, a first-line indent should be no smaller than the font-size of the text, otherwise it will be hard to see. Indent should be related to the type size and/or line-height, or it could be based on some unit of the typographic grid. 1-2 em is the most common recommendation.

In CSS, use [adjacent sibling selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors) *p + p* to indent paragraphs that follow another paragraph instead of every paragraph. Paragraphs that follow a heading or sub-heading should not be indented, nor should there be an indent following elements such as lists and block quotes.

Furthermore, the line space between paragraphs that most browsers insert by default should be removed. Browsers create this line break by adding a top and bottom margin to paragraphs; the bottom margin should be removed from all paragraphs, and the top margin removed from those paragraphs that follow another paragraph.

### Space Between Paragraphs

The space between paragraphs should be large enough to be easily noticed, but not so large that the paragraphs seem disconnected. The larger the font-size, the more space needs to be between paragraphs to make a visible difference.

Don’t use double hard returns to create space between paragraphs. Instead use CSS margin properties, which have more precise control over the amount of space. Some designers use the formula of **line-height × 0.75 ≈ paragraph spacing** for the top and bottom margin sizes.

### Other Methods to Separate Paragraphs

There are other methods to separate paragraphs. Among them are outdenting the first line of text, adding a graphic elements between paragraphs or at the beginning of each paragraph, and using a drop-cap or an elevated-cap at the beginning of the article.

# Punctuation



## Quotation Marks

Quotation marks are used to set off speech or to highlight excerpted text. The rigorously vertical marks typed directly from the keyboard are not proper quotation marks. A proper quotation mark is rounded and more angular than the ambidextrous version produced by the keyboard. According to HTML specifications, three elements are available to mark up quotations: <blockquote>, <q> and <cite>

### <blockquote>

<blockquote> is used for long quotations. The quoted text is supposed to be set apart from the main text body. Using <blockquote> causes the text to indent on both the right and the left.

### <q>

<q> is used for in-line quotations. Using CSS, the designer can modify the appearance of quotations. And because [quote marks are not the same in different languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English_usage_of_quotation_marks), the <q> tag can be defined with language pseudo-class. For example: q:lang(en) specifies English.

### <cite>

<cite> defines an in-line citation or reference to another source, such as the name of a person being quoted. The text within the quote will be italic by default.

### Style the Quote

The current trend is to use large graphical quotation marks at the top left and the lower right corners of the quoted area. The before and after pseudo-selectors can be used to add quotation marks automatically to the quotes. These elements also are  used in conjunction with the *content* property. 



[quote]

![uot](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/quote.png)



## Dashes

The dash from the keyboard, like the quotation mark, is another catch-all character that poorly represents the range of properly styled dashes. There are three main types of dash: the em dash, the en dash, and the hyphen.

### em dash

—, HTML code &mdash;, is the width of a lowercase “m”(1em). It denotes an interruption in speed—like this. Em dashes usually are set without spaces on either side.

### en dash

–, HTML code &ndash;, is traditionally longer than a hyphen and half the width of an em dash. It indicates ranges of values, as in “pages 32–35,” and connections between terms, as in “New York–Boston train.”

### hyphen

The hyphen ties together compound words. A hard hyphen joins words, as in “mixed-media,” or sets of digits, as in phone numbers.

A soft hyphen appears at the end of a line of text to indicate that a word continues on the next line. It usually appears with [justified alignment](https://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/alignment.html) settings. If the entire word ends up being written on one line, then the hyphen should disappear. On the web, the soft hyphen isn’t much of a concern because browsers do not yet have standard hyphenation controls.

[dash]

![as](/Users/yulei/Documents/HUB/HTMLCSSJS_Study/-Staff-/- Guideline -/Typography/TypographyPIC/dash.png)



## Other Characters

### Ellipsis

The ellipsis denotes either the omission of text or an interruption or hesitation. Although it is very common to use three periods as an ellipsis, most fonts have built-in ellipsis characters. Proper ellipsis characters are spaced out slightly more than three consecutive periods.

The HTML code for a proper ellipsis is &hellip**;**. Some typographers prefer to set custom ellipses by using thin spaces (&thinsp;) between periods. The general rule is to use an ellipsis that makes spacing consistent within the text block.

### Math Symbols

A hyphen is not a minus sign (**−** &minus;), and neither a lowercase x nor an asterisk (*) is a multiplication sign (**×** &times;). Using a slash for fractions does not produce the proper look of having numerator above and the denominator below, as you can see when comparing 1/2 vs. **½** (&frac12;). And the slash is not a division sign (**÷** &divide; ), either.

A complete list of special characters in HTML code by W3Schools is available [here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_entities.asp). 

### Accent Marks

Accent marks, or diacritics, are used in many Latin alphabet-based languages to change the sound value of the letter to which they are added. They also are used in several English words that were borrowed from other languages, such as déjà vu.

[typeit.org](http://www.typeit.org/) allows people to add typographic accents and special characters directly while typing. 



## Writing Fractions in HTML

http://changelog.ca/log/2008/07/01/writing_fractions_in_html



**Fractions** are so much a part of our life.  We see them everywhere.  And with pen and paper we write them frequently.		

But how do you write them on the computer ? How do you write them in *HTML* ?

How do you write fractions like: 1⁄10, 3⁄7, and 999⁄1000?

### Using a Slash

 Most people who want to write a fraction on a computer use the *slash* character.  It's a character on most keywords, and look like this....            

> **/**			

So, for example, a fraction written using a *slash* might look like....            

> 3 / 7			

While this might get you by, it's hardly what you'd write with pen and paper.            

(The "line" should be more horizontal.  And the numerator should be up top.  And the denominator should be down under.)            

### HTML Fraction Entities

*HTML* does have a small limited amout of special *HTML entities* for certain fractions.  Namely....            

> ¼   (one quarter)
> ½   (one half)
> ¾   (three fourths)            

You can write these fractions with the follow HTML entities....            

| Fraction | HTML Entity | Decimal Entity | Hexadecimal Entity |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| ¼        | `&frac14;`  | `&#188;`       | `&#xBC;`           |
| ½        | `&frac12;`  | `&#189;`       | `&#xBD;`           |
| ¾        | `&frac34;`  | `&#190;`       | `&#xBE;`           |

However, what happens if you want to write a fraction besides these 3 fractions‽            

That's where the HTML *fraction slash* comes into play.            

## HTML Fraction Slash

With the HTML *fraction slash* you can write any fraction you want.  For example, here's one....            

> 5⁄9			

The key to writing fractions, in HTML, this way is the HTML *fraction slash* entity.  This is created with the following HTML entity....            

> **&frasl;**			

 Just a note, you can write this same HTML entity using its *decimal entity* and *hexadecimal entity* variations, as....            

> **&#8260;**
> **&#x2044;**

These two variations -- the *decimal entity* and the *hexadecimal entity* -- would be useful in cases where you cannot use the HTML `**&frasl;**` entity.  Like in *XML*, *RSS*, or *Atom*.            

Now, just using the HTML *fraction slash* entity, by itself, is really not enough.  Consider if you wrote something like the following....            

```
1&frasl;10
```

  ... it will look like....            

> 1⁄10			

 ... which, as you can see, doesn't look right.            

 What we want is the *numerator* to be up top, and the *denominator* to be down bottom.  To do this we use the **HTML sup Element** and the **HTML sub Element**, respectively.            

 So, the code ends up being....            

```
<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>
```

Which gives you....            

> 1⁄10			

 Which looks closer to how a fraction should look like.            

And that's how you write a fraction in HTML.

# Color



## Choosing Colors

Although using black or dark grey text on a white background offers the highest amount of contrast and thus provides great readability, a hint of bold, bright color somewhere can easily grab the viewer's attention. Colors can bring more flair to type. However, just as with typefaces, it is easy to lose control if too many are involved. It is color's rarity that makes it noticeable and powerful.

In addition to considering how the color choices complement other parts of the design and the product branding, the designer must understand that colors also evoke different emotional associations. Also, colors may have different meanings in different industries and cultures. For example, green is the obvious color choice for nature and life, but it also represents jealousy and greed. It is important to use the right color to help a word have additional meaning or feeling.

There also are technical concerns when choosing colors for the web. A Macintosh usually display colors more brightly than does a Windows machine. The same color may appear drastically different on different types of monitors as well.

**TIP**

Consider these guidelines when making color choices for the web: 

- Work out the color scheme at the beginning of the design process. Color should be designed, not added as an afterthought.
- If the headlines are already stand out thanks to their font-size and style, then it may not be necessary to use different colors. Too many visual attributes can cause confusion and redundancy. 
- It is a usability issue if links are not presented in a separate color.  Even if  other styles such as underline are used to  distinguish links, such as underline, they need to be in a different color than the rest of the text.
- Choose at least one and no more than two highlight colors for all text. Use them consistently: for instance, if one color represents links, then text in that color should always link to somewhere.

CSS has the option of setting the foreground color and the background color. Colors can be defined in three ways:

Common names

```
body { color: black; }	
```

Hexadecimal value

```
h1 { color: #ff000;
 background-color: #808080; }
```

RGB value

```
p { color:rgb(102,102,102); }
```

-  ​

	 ​				

## Creating Contrast

Coloring type for emphasis is another method commonly used to create visual hierarchy.

However, it is almost impossible to see a color by itself in isolation from its surroundings. Any given color is perceived differently when combined with a range of other colors. Bauhaus master Johannes Itten and one of his students, Joseph Albers, made an in-depth study of[ color theory and the interaction of colors](http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs092/VA10/HTML/AlbersExplanation.html). 

Therefore, to consider a color choice for type, the designer must look at it with its environment. Contrast should be one of the major considerations when choosing colors for typography.

With different colors there is also a hierarchy of emphasis. For instance, yellow stands out more than red on a blue background [fig.1].   Straight black text on a white background can be a little harsh, so many designers experiment with  variations of darker grays, such as charcoal gray (#333333). To design something monochromatic, different tints and shades can be used to emulate the effect of type weight [fig.2].

**TIP**

The rule of creating color contrast to enhance hierary and readability is: Create contrast between values, not hues.

>**Value** is the relative lightness or darkness of a color.
>
>**Hue** is the technical term for what people usually describe as the attribute of a color: red, purple, blue, etc.

For instance, a medium-value blue sitting on top of a medium-value red produces some contrast; people can see the difference between the two. But when  two colors of similar value are together, it produces  color vibration. The line where the blue and the red meet seems to oscillate bewteen the two.  It almost feels like the text is pulsing [fig.3].

This technique can be used if the designer's goal is to produce something really vibrant—but it's hard on the eyes, and most people will find it annoying.
